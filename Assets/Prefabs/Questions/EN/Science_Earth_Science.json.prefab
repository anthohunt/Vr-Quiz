      - Rodinia
      Explanation: Pangaea was the name of the supercontinent that included almost
        all of Earth's landmasses before breaking up into the continents we know
        today.
    - Question: Which process causes the movement of tectonic plates?
      TrueAnswer: Plate tectonics
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weathering
      - Erosion
      - Sedimentation
      Explanation: Plate tectonics is the process driving the movement of the Earth's
        lithosphere, leading to the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic
        activity.
    - Question: What is the ridge formed at the boundaries of tectonic plates?
      TrueAnswer: Mid-ocean ridge
      FalseAnswer:
      - Trench
      - Fault
      - Rift valley
      Explanation: Mid-ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges that form at divergent
        boundaries where tectonic plates are moving apart.
    - Question: What term describes the breaking and shifting of Earth's crust?
      TrueAnswer: Tectonic movement
      FalseAnswer:
      - Glacial erosion
      - Avalanche
      - Sand dune formation
      Explanation: Tectonic movement refers to the large-scale processes that cause
        the Earth's crust to break and move, resulting in geological features and
        phenomena.
    - Question: Which layer of the Earth is made of semi-fluid, ductile rock?
      TrueAnswer: Mantle
      FalseAnswer:
      - Crust
      - Core
      - Asthenosphere
      Explanation: The mantle is a layer of the Earth's interior located between
        the crust and the outer core, consisting of semi-fluid, ductile rock material.
    - Question: What is the thickest layer of the Earth?
      TrueAnswer: Mantle
      FalseAnswer:
      - Core
      - Crust
      - Asthenosphere
      Explanation: The mantle is the thickest layer of the Earth, extending from
        the base of the crust to the outer core.
    - Question: What does the Richter scale measure?
      TrueAnswer: Earthquake magnitude
      FalseAnswer:
      - Volcanic eruption intensity
      - Tsunami speed
      - Hurricane wind speed
      Explanation: The Richter scale measures the magnitude of earthquakes, indicating
        the energy released at the source.
    - Question: How are sedimentary rocks formed?
      TrueAnswer: By compression and cementation
      FalseAnswer:
      - By melting and cooling
      - By crystallization from magma
      - By metamorphism under heat and pressure
      Explanation: Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation, compression, and
        cementation of sediments, which can be derived from the erosion of pre-existing
        rocks.
    - Question: What is the process of soil being removed by wind or water?
      TrueAnswer: Erosion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Deposition
      - Weathering
      - Subsidence
      Explanation: Erosion refers to the transportation of soil and rock particles
        by wind, water, or ice, leading to changes in the landscape.
    - Question: What is the primary gas emitted during volcanic eruptions?
      TrueAnswer: Water vapor
      FalseAnswer:
      - Carbon dioxide
      - Sulfur dioxide
      - Methane
      Explanation: Water vapor is the most abundant gas emitted during volcanic eruptions,
        contributing to the formation of volcanic clouds and atmospheric changes.

        of magma or lava?
      TrueAnswer: Igneous
      FalseAnswer:
      - Sedimentary
      - Metamorphic
      - Crystalline
      Explanation: Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of

        particles?
      TrueAnswer: Weathering
      FalseAnswer:
      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      - Sedimentation
      Explanation: Weathering involves the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks
        at or near the Earth's surface, leading to the formation of sedimentary deposits.
    - Question: What is the primary driver of weathering and erosion?
      TrueAnswer: Water
      FalseAnswer:
      - Wind
      - Ice
      - Gravity
      Explanation: Water, through rainfall, rivers, and waves, plays a significant
        role in weathering rocks and transporting sediments, shaping the Earth's
        surface.
    - Question: What is the term for the layer of Earth's atmosphere where weather
        occurs?
      TrueAnswer: Troposphere
      FalseAnswer:
      - Stratosphere
      - Mesosphere
      - Thermosphere
      Explanation: The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere

      TrueAnswer: Iron
      FalseAnswer:
      - Gold
      - Silver
      - Copper
      Explanation: Iron is the primary element forming the Earth's inner core, contributing

      TrueAnswer: Deposition
      FalseAnswer:
      - Erosion
      - Weathering
      - Sedimentation
      Explanation: Deposition occurs when eroded soil and rock particles settle and
        accumulate in a new location, often forming sedimentary layers over time.
