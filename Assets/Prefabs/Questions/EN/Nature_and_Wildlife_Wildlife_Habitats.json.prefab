        sustaining diverse avian populations in coastal regions.
    - Question: How does human activity impact marine habitat through plastic pollution?
      TrueAnswer: Harmful
      FalseAnswer:
      - Beneficial
      - Neutral
      - Beneficial
      Explanation: Plastic pollution poses a severe threat to marine animals, causing
        entanglement, ingestion, and disrupting marine food chains.
    - Question: What contributes to the degradation of grassland wildlife habitats?
      TrueAnswer: Overgrazing
      FalseAnswer:
      - Ground fires
      - Habitat restoration
      - Reforestation
      Explanation: Overgrazing by livestock can lead to soil compaction, reduced
        vegetation, and erosion, degrading grassland habitats.
    - Question: What impacts wildlife habitats in colder regions due to climate change?
      TrueAnswer: Melting permafrost
      FalseAnswer:
      - Heavy snowfall
      - Glacial advance
      - Decreased precipitation
      Explanation: Melting permafrost alters the landscape, leading to habitat loss,
        destabilizing ecosystems, and impacting indigenous communities.
    - Question: Which habitat is characterized by rocky terrain, minimal vegetation,
        and extreme temperature fluctuations?
      TrueAnswer: Tundra
      FalseAnswer:
      - Temperate forest
      - Savanna
      - Mangrove swamp
      Explanation: The tundra is a cold, treeless biome with a fragile ecosystem
        adapted to harsh conditions and supporting specialized wildlife species.
    - Question: How do forest fires affect wildlife habitat in temperate forests?
      TrueAnswer: Renewal
      FalseAnswer:
      - Destruction
      - Flooding
      - Pollution
      Explanation: Forest fires clear old growth, promoting new growth and enhancing
        habitat diversity, crucial for certain plant and animal species.
    - Question: How do wetland habitat restoration projects benefit wildlife?
      TrueAnswer: Enhance biodiversity
      FalseAnswer:
      - Habitat destruction
      - Reduce waterfowl populations
      - Increase pollution levels
      Explanation: Wetland restoration efforts create diverse habitats, providing
        shelter, breeding, and feeding areas crucial for various species survival
        and recovery.
    - Question: What causes degradation of oceanic habitat impacting marine species?
      TrueAnswer: Overfishing
      FalseAnswer:
      - Marine reserves
      - Climate change
      - Ocean acidification
      Explanation: Overfishing disrupts marine ecosystems, depleting fish stocks,
        altering food webs, and causing population declines of marine species.
    - Question: Which wildlife habitat is under threat due to invasive plant species?
      TrueAnswer: Grassland
      FalseAnswer:
      - Tropical rainforest
      - Wetland
