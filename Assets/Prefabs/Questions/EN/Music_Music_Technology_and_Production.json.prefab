      Explanation: A compressor reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal, making
        quiet sounds louder and loud sounds quieter, resulting in a more consistent
        sound.
    - Question: Which type of synthesizer generates sound through analog electronic
        circuits?
      TrueAnswer: Analog synthesizer
      FalseAnswer:
      - Digital synthesizer
      - FM synthesizer
      - Sample-based synthesizer
      Explanation: Analog synthesizers create sound by manipulating electrical voltages,
        resulting in a warm, organic, and often unpredictable sonic character.
    - Question: What technology allows for non-destructive editing of audio recordings?
      TrueAnswer: Audio waveform editing
      FalseAnswer:
      - Binary editing
      - Linear editing

      Explanation: Non-destructive editing enables audio files to be edited without
        permanently altering the original recordings, preserving the integrity of
        the source material.
    - Question: Which type of studio monitor is designed to reproduce a flat, uncolored
        sound?
      TrueAnswer: Near-field monitor
      FalseAnswer:
      - Far-field monitor
      - Subwoofer
      - Hi-fi speaker
      Explanation: Near-field monitors deliver a balanced and accurate representation
        of audio, making them ideal for critical monitoring and mixing tasks in a
        studio environment.
    - Question: What is the purpose of a low-pass filter in audio processing?
      TrueAnswer: Attenuate high frequencies
      FalseAnswer:
      - Boost low frequencies
      - Create resonance
      - Add distortion
      Explanation: A low-pass filter allows frequencies below a certain cutoff point
        to pass through while attenuating frequencies above it, effectively reducing
        high-frequency content in the signal.
    - Question: What type of connector is commonly used for balanced audio signals?
      TrueAnswer: XLR
      FalseAnswer:
      - TRS
      - RCA
      - USB
      Explanation: XLR connectors are preferred for balanced audio connections due
        to their ability to minimize interference and transmit audio signals over
        longer distances with better signal integrity.
    - Question: Which audio file format is known for its lossless compression and
        high sound quality?
      TrueAnswer: FLAC
      FalseAnswer:
      - MP3
      - AAC
      - WAV
      Explanation: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) preserves the original audio
        quality without sacrificing file size, making it a popular choice for high-fidelity
        audio archiving and distribution.
    - Question: What is the purpose of a gate in audio production?
      TrueAnswer: Noise suppression
      FalseAnswer:
      - Echo effect
      - Pitch modulation
      - Frequency shifting
      Explanation: A gate is used to control the volume of audio signals, allowing
        only signals above a certain threshold to pass through, effectively reducing
        background noise and unwanted sounds.
    - Question: Which parameter does a tremolo effect modulate in an audio signal?
      TrueAnswer: Amplitude
      FalseAnswer:
      - Frequency
      - Phase
      - Time
      Explanation: Tremolo alters the volume of a signal at a regular, rhythmic rate,
        creating a pulsating effect by modulating its amplitude over time.
    - Question: What does the term 'dithering' refer to in digital audio processing?
      TrueAnswer: Noise shaping
      FalseAnswer:
      - Frequency modulation
      - Phase inversion
      - Digital filtering

      FalseAnswer:
      - Pitch-shifting
      - Harmonizing
      - Filtering
      Explanation: Time-stretching changes the duration of an audio signal without
        affecting its pitch, enabling the manipulation of tempo and timing while
        preserving pitch and tonality.
    - Question: What is the purpose of a sidechain compressor in audio production?
      TrueAnswer: Ducking effect
      FalseAnswer:
      - Reverb tail shaping
      - Stereo widening
      - Phase cancellation
      Explanation: A sidechain compressor is used to create the 'ducking' effect
        by dynamically reducing the level of one signal based on the level of another,
        commonly used in dance music for the pumping sound.
