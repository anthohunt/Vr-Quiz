  - Questions:
    - Question: How do bees communicate the location of a food source to other bees?
      TrueAnswer: Waggle dance
      FalseAnswer:
      - Quiver
      - Flutter
      - Shake
      Explanation: Bees perform the waggle dance to communicate the direction and
        distance of a food source to other bees in the hive.
    - Question: What is the primary method of CO2 exchange in aquatic plants?
      TrueAnswer: Diffusion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Osmosis
      - Active transport
      - Facilitated diffusion
      Explanation: Aquatic plants exchange CO2 through diffusion, where gases move
        from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.
    - Question: Which species is known for its unique relationship with acacia trees?
      TrueAnswer: Ants
      FalseAnswer:
      - Bees
      - Butterflies
      - Spider
      Explanation: Certain ant species have a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship
        with acacia trees, where the ants defend the tree and receive shelter and
        food in return.
    - Question: What does the term 'keystone species' refer to in ecology?
      TrueAnswer: A species that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment
      FalseAnswer:
      - A species at risk of extinction
      - A species with limited habitat range
      - A species with low population density
      Explanation: A keystone species plays a critical role in maintaining the structure
        and function of an ecosystem, often by regulating the population of other
        species.
    - Question: Which of the following is NOT an example of a trophic level?
      TrueAnswer: Decomposers
      FalseAnswer:
      - Primary producers
      - Primary consumers
      - Secondary consumers
      Explanation: Decomposers, like fungi and bacteria, are not classified as trophic
        levels but play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and recycling
        nutrients in ecosystems.
