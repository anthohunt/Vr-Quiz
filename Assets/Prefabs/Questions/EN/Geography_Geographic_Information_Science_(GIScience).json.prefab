  - Questions:
    - Question: What does GIS stand for?
      TrueAnswer: Geographic Information Systems
      FalseAnswer:
      - Global Information System
      - Ground Information Science
      - Geological Information Software
      Explanation: GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems, which is a system
        designed to capture, store, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic
        data.
    - Question: Which type of data does GIS primarily deal with?
      TrueAnswer: Spatial
      FalseAnswer:
      - Temporal
      - Categorical
      - Numerical
      Explanation: GIS primarily manages Spatial data, which includes information
        about the location and shape of geographic features.
    - Question: What is the purpose of geocoding in GIS?
      TrueAnswer: To assign geographic coordinates to locations
      FalseAnswer:
      - To categorize landforms
      - To measure atmospheric conditions
      - To analyze demographic trends
      Explanation: Geocoding involves assigning geographic coordinates (latitude
        and longitude) to a description of a location, allowing it to be accurately
        placed on a map.
    - Question: Which technology is commonly used to collect geospatial data?
      TrueAnswer: GPS
      FalseAnswer:
      - Radar
      - Sonar
      - Laser scanning
      Explanation: GPS (Global Positioning System) is widely used to collect geospatial
        data, providing precise location information through satellite signals.
    - Question: What is remote sensing in the context of GIScience?
      TrueAnswer: Gathering data from a distance
      FalseAnswer:
      - Direct data collection
      - Physical data manipulation
      - Digital map creation
      Explanation: Remote sensing involves collecting data about the Earth's surface
        from a distance, often through satellites or aerial photography, to create
        detailed maps and analyze changes in the environment.
    - Question: Which type of analysis identifies the best location for a new retail
        store?
      TrueAnswer: Site suitability analysis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Network analysis
      - Overlay analysis
      - Proximity analysis
      Explanation: Site suitability analysis evaluates various criteria to determine
        the most suitable location for a specific purpose, such as a retail store,
        considering factors like accessibility, competition, and consumer demographics.
    - Question: What is the purpose of a geospatial database?
      TrueAnswer: To store, retrieve, and analyze spatial data
      FalseAnswer:
      - To manage financial information
      - To store multimedia files
      - To track employee records
      Explanation: A geospatial database is specifically designed to store, retrieve,
        and analyze spatial data, enabling efficient management and retrieval of
        geographic information for various applications.
    - Question: Which projection preserves accurate area but distorts shapes and
        angles?
      TrueAnswer: Equal Area (or Equivalent) projection
      FalseAnswer:
      - Conformal projection
      - Equidistant projection
      - Azimuthal projection
      Explanation: The Equal Area projection preserves accurate area measurements,
        making it suitable for thematic mapping where maintaining relative sizes
        of geographic features is more important than preserving shapes and angles.
    - Question: What is meant by the term 'geospatial analysis'?
      TrueAnswer: Analyzing geographic data
      FalseAnswer:
      - Statistical analysis
      - Market analysis
      - Textual analysis
      Explanation: Geospatial analysis involves examining geographic data, including
        patterns, trends, and relationships, to gain insights into spatial phenomena
        and inform decision-making in various fields.
    - Question: Which GIS application enables the creation of customized maps?
      TrueAnswer: Cartography
      FalseAnswer:
      - Geocaching
      - Geotagging
      - Georeferencing
      Explanation: Cartography is the process of creating customized maps, involving
        the design, compilation, and production of geographic information for visualization
        and communication purposes.
