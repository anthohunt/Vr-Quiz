        species?
      TrueAnswer: Temperature
      FalseAnswer:
      - Humidity
      - Sunlight Intensity
      - Wind Speed
      Explanation: Temperature affects the metabolic rates, growth, and reproduction
        of freshwater organisms, shaping their distribution patterns.
    - Question: Which nutrient is often a limiting factor for freshwater ecosystem
        productivity?
      TrueAnswer: Phosphorus
      FalseAnswer:
      - Calcium
      - Nitrogen
      - Potassium
      Explanation: Phosphorus availability influences the growth of primary producers
        and can limit the overall productivity of freshwater ecosystems.
    - Question: What is a defining feature of an oxbow lake in a freshwater ecosystem?
      TrueAnswer: Crescent Shape
      FalseAnswer:
      - Linear Extension
      - Circular Depth
      - Irregular Shoreline
      Explanation: Oxbow lakes are formed from the meandering of rivers, creating
        crescent-shaped water bodies that support diverse ecological niches.
    - Question: How do beavers impact freshwater ecosystems?
      TrueAnswer: Habitat Modification
      FalseAnswer:
