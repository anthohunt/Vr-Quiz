      - Killer Whale
      - Giant Squid
      Explanation: The Blue Whale, the largest animal on Earth, is often referred
        to as the 'Giant of the Sea' due to its colossal size.
    - Question: What is the primary function of a coral polyp in a coral reef?
      TrueAnswer: Build Reef Structure
      FalseAnswer:
      - Photosynthesis
      - Filtering Water
      - Reproduction
      Explanation: Coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate to build the intricate
        structures of coral reefs, providing habitat and protection for numerous
        marine organisms.
    - Question: Which marine species is capable of camouflaging itself by changing
        color?
      TrueAnswer: Cuttlefish
      FalseAnswer:
      - Octopus
      - Seahorse
      - Squid
      Explanation: Cuttlefish possess specialized skin cells that enable them to
        change color and texture, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings.
    - Question: What is the primary mechanism through which marine organisms remove
        carbon dioxide from seawater?
      TrueAnswer: Calcification
      FalseAnswer:
      - Respiration
      - Photosynthesis
      - Hydrothermal Venting
      Explanation: Calcification is the process by which marine organisms such as
        corals and mollusks extract carbon to form calcium carbonate structures,
        sequestering carbon dioxide from seawater.
    - Question: Which marine reptile is known for its ability to migrate long distances
        across the oceans?
      TrueAnswer: Sea Turtle
      FalseAnswer:
      - Crocodile
