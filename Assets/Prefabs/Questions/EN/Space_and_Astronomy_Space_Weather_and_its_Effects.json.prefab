  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the main source of space weather?
      TrueAnswer: The Sun
      FalseAnswer:
      - Jupiter
      - Neutron Star
      - Saturn
      Explanation: The Sun is the primary source of space weather, generating solar
        winds and solar flares that affect the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere.
    - Question: What is the name of the region where Earth's magnetic field traps
        charged particles?
      TrueAnswer: Van Allen Belts
      FalseAnswer:
      - Oort Cloud
      - Kuiper Belt
      - Asteroid Belt
      Explanation: The Van Allen Belts are zones of charged particles, held in place
        by the Earth's magnetic field, and can be affected by space weather events.
    - Question: How often does the Sun go through its solar cycle?
      TrueAnswer: 11 years
      FalseAnswer:
      - 5 years
      - 17 years
      - 23 years
      Explanation: The Sun's solar cycle lasts approximately 11 years, during which
        it goes through periods of high and low sunspot activity and solar flares.
    - Question: What is the name for the disruption of Earth's ionosphere caused
        by space weather?
      TrueAnswer: Ionospheric Storm
      FalseAnswer:
      - Magnetic Reversal
      - Terraforming Event
      - Astrological Shift
      Explanation: An ionospheric storm occurs when the ionosphere is disturbed by
        solar flares, leading to disruptions in radio communications and GPS signals.
    - Question: Which type of radiation from space weather can pose a threat to astronauts?
      TrueAnswer: Solar Flares
      FalseAnswer:
      - Cosmic Rays
      - Gamma Rays
      - X-Rays
      Explanation: Solar flares release bursts of high-energy radiation that, if
        astronauts are exposed, can lead to increased cancer risk and other health
        issues.
    - Question: What effect does space weather have on power grids?
      TrueAnswer: Geomagnetic Storms
      FalseAnswer:
      - Heat Waves
      - Avalanches
      - Earthquakes
      Explanation: Geomagnetic storms induced by space weather can induce electric
        currents in power lines, leading to transformer damage and power outages.
    - Question: What is the term for the auroras that occur due to space weather?
      TrueAnswer: Northern Lights
      FalseAnswer:
      - Meteor Showers
      - Tornadoes
      - Dust Storms
      Explanation: The Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) and the Southern Lights
        (Aurora Australis) are caused by space weather interacting with Earth's magnetosphere.
    - Question: Which layer of the Earth's atmosphere is affected by space weather?
      TrueAnswer: Ionosphere
      FalseAnswer:
      - Exosphere
      - Troposphere
      - Mesosphere
      Explanation: Space weather phenomena can impact the ionosphere, a region of
        the Earth's atmosphere important for communication and navigation systems.
    - Question: What is the space weather phenomenon characterized by temporary magnetosphere
        disturbances?
      TrueAnswer: Magnetic Storms
      FalseAnswer:
      - Dust Devils
      - Meteors
      - Lunar Eclipses
      Explanation: Magnetic storms are disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere
        caused by solar wind and can disrupt satellite and communication systems.
    - Question: What is the term for the flow of energized particles from the Sun?
      TrueAnswer: Solar Wind
      FalseAnswer:
      - Coronal Mass Ejection
      - Stellar Nova
      - Gravitational Lensing
      Explanation: The solar wind is a stream of charged particles, primarily protons
        and electrons, flowing from the Sun and impacting space weather around Earth.
