    - Question: Which phenomenon describes the tendency for organisms to evolve similar
        traits in response to similar environmental challenges, despite not being
        closely related?
      TrueAnswer: Convergent evolution
      FalseAnswer:
      - Divergent evolution
      - Parallel evolution
      - Co-evolution
      Explanation: Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features
        in different lineages, driven by adaptation to similar environmental conditions
        or challenges.
    - Question: What genetic phenomenon refers to the random fluctuation of allele
        frequencies in a population, often leading to random changes in appearance
        and behavior?
      TrueAnswer: Genetic drift
      FalseAnswer:
      - Gene flow
      - Mutation
      - Selection
      Explanation: Genetic drift is a stochastic process that can lead to significant
        changes in small populations, often resulting in the loss of genetic diversity.
    - Question: Which concept refers to the study of the genetic composition of populations
        and how it changes over time?
      TrueAnswer: Population genetics
      FalseAnswer:
      - Phylogenetics
      - Paleontology
      - Embryology
      Explanation: Population genetics focuses on the genetic variation and dynamics
        within and between populations, providing insight into evolutionary processes
        such as natural selection and genetic drift.
    - Question: What term describes the change in a species' behavioral, physiological,
        or anatomical traits in response to environmental pressures?
      TrueAnswer: Adaptation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Mutation
      - Speciation
      - Extinction
      Explanation: Adaptation is the fundamental process driving the evolution of
        species, enabling organisms to better survive and reproduce in their specific
        environment.

        to family in biological classification?
      TrueAnswer: Genus
      FalseAnswer:
      - Order
      - Phylum
      - Class
      Explanation: The genus is a rank in the biological classification hierarchy,
        consisting of one or more species closely related in evolutionary terms.
    - Question: What phenomenon describes the diversification of a single ancestral
        species into a large number of related species?
      TrueAnswer: Adaptive radiation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Punctuated equilibrium
      - Speciation
      - Convergent evolution
      Explanation: Adaptive radiation is a rapid evolutionary divergence that results
        in a wide array of species adapted to various ecological niches, often triggered
        by environmental changes.
    - Question: What concept suggests that the development of an organism (ontogeny)
        reflects its evolutionary history (phylogeny) through embryonic stages?
      TrueAnswer: Embryological homology
      FalseAnswer:
      - Vestigial structures
      - Parallel evolution
      - Convergent evolution
      Explanation: Embryological homology is the principle that similarities in embryonic
        development across different species reflect their shared evolutionary ancestry.
    - Question: Which scientist is known for the theory of evolution through the
        inheritance of acquired characteristics, later disproven by natural selection?
      TrueAnswer: Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
      FalseAnswer:
      - Thomas Huxley
      - Alfred Russel Wallace
      - Gregor Mendel
      Explanation: Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed the idea of inheritance of acquired
        characteristics, suggesting that organisms could pass on traits acquired
        during their lifetime. This concept was later refuted by the theory of natural
        selection.
    - Question: What process involves the formation of new species through the geographic
        isolation of populations, leading to reproductive barriers?
      TrueAnswer: Allopatric speciation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Sympatric speciation
      - Parapatric speciation
      - Peripatric speciation
      Explanation: Allopatric speciation occurs when a population is separated by
        a physical barrier, creating genetic divergence and eventually leading to
        the formation of new species.
    - Question: What is the term for the study of the geographical distribution of
        species and ecosystems?
      TrueAnswer: Biogeography
      FalseAnswer:
      - Ecology
      - Ethology
      - Paleontology
      Explanation: Biogeography investigates the distribution of species and ecosystems
        across geographic space and through geological time, shedding light on factors
        influencing evolutionary patterns.
    - Question: Which principle suggests that the frequency of an allele will increase
        in a population if it provides a survival or reproductive advantage?
      TrueAnswer: Selection
      FalseAnswer:
      - Mutation
      - Genetic drift
      - Gene flow
      Explanation: Selection, whether natural or artificial, leads to the differential
        survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous genetic traits,
        driving evolutionary change.
