  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the purpose of GIS software?
      TrueAnswer: Spatial analysis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Graphic design
      - Audio processing
      - Text editing
      Explanation: GIS software is designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze,
        manage, and present all types of geographical data. It enables spatial analysis
        for various applications.
    - Question: Which of the following is a satellite-based navigation system?
      TrueAnswer: GPS
      FalseAnswer:
      - RADAR
      - Sonar
      - LIDAR
      Explanation: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation
        system that provides location and time information in all weather conditions,
        anywhere on or near the Earth.
    - Question: What is the primary function of LiDAR technology?
      TrueAnswer: 3D mapping
      FalseAnswer:
      - Audio recording
      - Weather forecasting
      - Social networking
      Explanation: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology is used for generating
        precise and accurate 3D maps and models of the Earth's surface, terrain,
        and urban environments.
    - Question: What technology is used to create topographic maps?
      TrueAnswer: Remote sensing
      FalseAnswer:
      - Augmented reality
      - Blockchain
      - Biometrics
      Explanation: Remote sensing technology, such as aerial photography and satellite
        imagery, is essential for capturing data used in the creation of topographic
        maps.
    - Question: What technique is utilized in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
        for data visualization?
      TrueAnswer: Spatial interpolation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Temporal aggregation
      - Statistical regression
      - Sentiment analysis
      Explanation: Spatial interpolation is the method used in GIS for predicting
        values at unsampled locations based on measurements from sampled locations,
        facilitating data visualization and analysis.
