    - Question: What is the primary element in the gas clouds of a nebula?
      TrueAnswer: Hydrogen
      FalseAnswer:
      - Oxygen
      - Helium
      - Nitrogen
      Explanation: Nebulae are made up mostly of hydrogen gas, which is the primary
        element in these stellar nurseries.
    - Question: What causes the formation of a star from a nebula?
      TrueAnswer: Gravitational collapse
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nuclear fusion
      - Magnetic fields
      - Supernova explosion
      Explanation: When a nebula's gas and dust are pulled together by gravity, it
        forms a dense core and triggers the birth of a star.
    - Question: What is the 'Pillars of Creation' in the Eagle Nebula famous for?
      TrueAnswer: Star-forming regions
      FalseAnswer:
      - Planetary nebula
      - White dwarf remnants
      - Black hole formation
      Explanation: The 'Pillars of Creation' are massive columns of gas and dust
        where new stars are actively being born.
    - Question: What is the typical color of the emission nebulae?
      TrueAnswer: Red
      FalseAnswer:
      - Blue
      - Green
      - Yellow
      Explanation: The pinkish-red glow of emission nebulae is due to ionized hydrogen
        gas emitting light at specific wavelengths.
    - Question: What is responsible for the beautiful colors in reflection nebulae?
      TrueAnswer: Scattering of light
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nuclear fusion
      - Combustion reactions
      - Magnetic fields
      Explanation: The scattering of starlight by the tiny dust particles in reflection
        nebulae creates their characteristic blue colors.
    - Question: What is thought to be at the center of every planetary nebula?
      TrueAnswer: White dwarf
      FalseAnswer:
      - Main sequence star
      - Black hole
      - Neutron star
      Explanation: Planetary nebulae form when a dying star sheds its outer layers,
        exposing the hot, dense core, a white dwarf.
    - Question: What is the minimum mass requirement for a cloud to form a star?
      TrueAnswer: 0.08 solar masses
      FalseAnswer:
      - 1 solar mass
      - 0.001 solar masses
      - 10 solar masses
      Explanation: Objects with less than 0.08 solar masses cannot sustain nuclear
        fusion, but they can form into brown dwarfs.
    - Question: What is the primary force that counters gravitational collapse in
        a protostellar system?
      TrueAnswer: Gas pressure
      FalseAnswer:
      - Magnetic force
      - Radiation pressure
      - Centrifugal force
      Explanation: Gas pressure from within a protostellar system pushes outward,
        countering the gravitational collapse of the forming star.
    - Question: What is the primary element detected in the cooling shells of planetary
        nebulae?
      TrueAnswer: Oxygen
      FalseAnswer:
      - Carbon
      - Nitrogen
      - Helium
      Explanation: As a planetary nebula expands, the cooling shells reveal oxygen
        as the most abundant element other than hydrogen and helium.
    - Question: What is the process called when a massive star collapses, triggering
        star formation?
      TrueAnswer: Supernova explosion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Black hole formation
      - Nebular accretion
      - Planetary nebula ejection
      Explanation: When a massive star ends in a catastrophic explosion, it can initiate
        the formation of new stars from its remnants.
    - Question: What is the name of the region in a nebula where protostars form?
      TrueAnswer: Nebular clouds
      FalseAnswer:
      - Stellar engines
      - Accretion disks
      - T-Tauri stars
      Explanation: Nebular clouds are dense regions within a nebula where the gravitational
        collapse occurs to form protostars.
    - Question: What is the name of the process where a protostar begins nuclear
        fusion and becomes a star?
      TrueAnswer: T-Tauri phase
      FalseAnswer:
      - Substellar accretion
      - Photon emission
      - Pre-main sequence
      Explanation: The T-Tauri phase is when a protostar starts generating energy
        through nuclear fusion at its core, becoming a true star.
    - Question: What type of nebula is created when a massive star undergoes a supernova
        explosion?
      TrueAnswer: Supernova remnant
      FalseAnswer:
      - Planetary nebula
      - Emission nebula
      - Reflection nebula
      Explanation: The remnants from the dramatic end of a massive star create a
        supernova remnant, a diffuse nebula of expanding shock waves.
    - Question: What is the primary cause of the beautiful shapes in planetary nebulae?
      TrueAnswer: Stellar winds
      FalseAnswer:
      - Magnetic fields
      - Cosmic radiation
      - Gravitational waves
      Explanation: As the dying star sheds its outer layers, the intricate shapes
        of planetary nebulae are formed by its strong stellar winds.
    - Question: What is the primary distinguishing feature of dark nebulae?
      TrueAnswer: Light absorption
      FalseAnswer:
      - Infrared emission
      - Ultraviolet fluorescence
      - X-ray reflection
      Explanation: Dark nebulae, also known as absorption nebulae, block the light
        from the stars behind them, creating dark patches in the sky.
    - Question: What is the main factor that influences the shape of a reflection
        nebula?
      TrueAnswer: Location of illuminating stars
      FalseAnswer:
      - Magnetic fields
      - Cosmic radiation
      - Gravitational waves
      Explanation: The arrangement of nearby stars relative to a reflection nebula
        affects its shape and the density of the surrounding gas and dust.
    - Question: What is the primary source of energy for most nebulae?
      TrueAnswer: Ultraviolet radiation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Cosmic rays
      - Infrared radiation
      - X-ray emissions
      Explanation: Ultraviolet radiation from young, hot stars is the primary energy
        source that ionizes the gas in many types of nebulae.
    - Question: What is the primary factor that determines the final fate of a star?
      TrueAnswer: Mass
      FalseAnswer:
      - Age
      - Temperature
      - Rotation
      Explanation: A star's mass primarily determines its evolution and ultimate
        fate, including whether it will end as a white dwarf, supernova, or black
        hole.
