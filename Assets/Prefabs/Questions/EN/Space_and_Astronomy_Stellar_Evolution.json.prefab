  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the last stage in the life of a massive star?
      TrueAnswer: Supernova
      FalseAnswer:
      - White dwarf
      - Neutron star
      - Black hole
      Explanation: When a massive star finishes burning its nuclear fuel, it undergoes
        a supernova explosion, scattering elements into space.
    - Question: How do stars generate energy during the main sequence phase?
      TrueAnswer: Nuclear fusion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nuclear fission
      - Chemical reactions
      - Convection
      Explanation: During the main sequence phase, stars convert hydrogen into helium
        through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.
    - Question: What prevents a neutron star from collapsing under its own gravity?
      TrueAnswer: Neutron degeneracy pressure
      FalseAnswer:
      - Electromagnetic repulsion
      - Gravitational pull
      - Nuclear fusion
      Explanation: Neutron degeneracy pressure is a force that counteracts gravity,
        preventing the collapse of neutron stars into black holes.
    - Question: What causes a supernova to occur in a binary star system?
      TrueAnswer: Mass transfer from a companion star
      FalseAnswer:
      - Planetary collision
      - Gamma-ray burst
      - Magnetic field disruption
      Explanation: In a binary star system, a supernova can occur when the companion
        star transfers mass onto the other, triggering a runaway nuclear reaction.
    - Question: What determines the final fate of a low-mass star after the red giant
        phase?
      TrueAnswer: Planetary nebula
      FalseAnswer:
      - White dwarf
      - Black dwarf
      - Neutron star
      Explanation: After the red giant phase, a low-mass star sheds its outer layers
        to form a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf.
    - Question: What is the primary energy source for a red giant star?
      TrueAnswer: Helium fusion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Hydrogen fusion
      - Carbon fusion
      - Nuclear fission
      Explanation: Red giant stars undergo helium fusion in their cores after exhausting
        hydrogen, generating energy and expanding in size.
    - Question: Which process is responsible for the formation of heavy elements
        in a supernova?
      TrueAnswer: R-process nucleosynthesis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Pulsar wind accretion
      - CNO cycle
      - Photodisintegration
      Explanation: During a supernova, rapid neutron capture in the r-process leads
        to the creation of heavy elements beyond iron.
    - Question: What feature distinguishes a Type II supernova from a Type Ia supernova?
      TrueAnswer: Presence of hydrogen in spectral lines
      FalseAnswer:
      - Presence of helium in spectral lines
      - Explosion of a white dwarf
      - Lack of an accompanying gamma-ray burst
      Explanation: Type II supernovae exhibit hydrogen spectral lines, indicating
        the explosion of a massive star, unlike Type Ia supernovae.
    - Question: Which stage follows the protostar phase in stellar evolution?
      TrueAnswer: T Tauri star
      FalseAnswer:
      - Herbig-Haro object
      - Main sequence star
      - Red dwarf star
      Explanation: After the protostar phase, a young star enters the T Tauri stage,
        characterized by strong stellar winds and intense magnetic activity.
    - Question: What is the end result of the core collapse of a high-mass star?
      TrueAnswer: Neutron star
      FalseAnswer:
      - White dwarf
      - Red giant
      - Black hole
      Explanation: The core collapse of a high-mass star leads to the formation of
        a neutron star, a dense remnant supported by neutron degeneracy pressure.
