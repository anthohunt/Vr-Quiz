  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the powerhouse of the cell?
      TrueAnswer: Mitochondria
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nucleus
      - Ribosome
      - Chloroplast
      Explanation: Mitochondria are organelles that act like a digestive system which
        takes in nutrients, breaks them down, and creates energy-rich molecules for
        the cell.
    - Question: What does DNA stand for?
      TrueAnswer: Deoxyribonucleic Acid
      FalseAnswer:
      - Digital Nucleic Acid
      - Dihydroxy Nitrogen Atom
      - Double Nucleotide Amino
      Explanation: DNA is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in
        the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living
        organisms and many viruses.
    - Question: Which gas do plants absorb during photosynthesis?
      TrueAnswer: Carbon Dioxide
      FalseAnswer:
      - Oxygen
      - Nitrogen
      - Hydrogen
      Explanation: During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide, water, and
        sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen as a byproduct.
    - Question: What is the largest organ in the human body?
      TrueAnswer: Skin
      FalseAnswer:
      - Liver
      - Brain
      - Lungs
      Explanation: The skin is the largest organ by surface area and weight, serving
        as a protective barrier against the environment and essential for many physiological
        functions.
    - Question: What is the process of cell division in eukaryotic cells called?
      TrueAnswer: Mitosis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Meiosis
      - Binary Fission
      - Hypertrophy
      Explanation: Mitosis is a process where a single cell divides into two identical
        daughter cells, each containing the same number of chromosomes and genetic
        content as the original cell.
