        and reduce stress, with potential health benefits such as improved sleep
        and digestion.
    - Question: What is the primary function of plant roots?
      TrueAnswer: Absorption of water and nutrients
      FalseAnswer:
      - Photosynthesis
      - Reproduction

      Explanation: The primary function of plant roots is the absorption of water
        and nutrients from the soil, providing essential resources for growth and
        development.
    - Question: Which of the following is not a type of plant tissue?
      TrueAnswer: Nervous
      FalseAnswer:
      - Epidermal
      - Vascular
      - Ground
      Explanation: Nervous tissue is exclusive to animals and not found in plants,
        while epidermal, vascular, and ground tissues are essential for plant structure
        and function.
    - Question: How do plants reproduce asexually?
      TrueAnswer: Vegetative propagation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Spores
      - Seeds
      - Pollen
      Explanation: Plants reproduce asexually through vegetative propagation, where
        new plants are grown from roots, stems, or leaves of the parent plant, without
        the need for seeds or spores.
    - Question: Which of the following is not a type of plant vascular tissue?
      TrueAnswer: Collenchyma
      FalseAnswer:
      - Xylem
      - Phloem
      - Cambium
      Explanation: Collenchyma is a type of ground tissue providing structural support
        in plants, distinct from the vascular tissues responsible for fluid transport.
    - Question: What is the process of pollen transfer between flowers called?
      TrueAnswer: Pollination
      FalseAnswer:
      - Germination
      - Fertilization
      - Senescence
      Explanation: Pollination is the process of pollen transfer between flowers,
        essential for successful fertilization and the production of seeds in flowering
        plants.
    - Question: Where does the process of germination occur in a plant?
      TrueAnswer: Seed
      FalseAnswer:
      - Root
      - Leaf
      - Stem
      Explanation: Germination occurs within the seed, initiating the growth of a
        new plant by absorbing water and activating metabolic processes to form roots
        and shoots.
    - Question: Which of the following is a major greenhouse gas produced by plants?
      TrueAnswer: Carbon dioxide
      FalseAnswer:
      - Oxygen
      - Methane
      - Nitrogen
      Explanation: Plants release oxygen through photosynthesis and absorb carbon
        dioxide, playing a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and regulation
        of atmospheric gases.
    - Question: What is the study of plant classification called?
      TrueAnswer: Taxonomy
      FalseAnswer:
      - Botany
      - Ecology
      - Genetics
      Explanation: Taxonomy is the scientific study of plant classification, including
        identification, naming, and organization of plant species based on their
        evolutionary relationships and traits.
    - Question: Which of the following is a parasitic plant without chlorophyll?
      TrueAnswer: Dodder
      FalseAnswer:
      - Dandelion
      - Rose
      - Sunflower
      Explanation: Dodder is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll, relying on
        other plants for nutrients and water through specialized structures called
        haustoria.

      TrueAnswer: Chlorophyll
      FalseAnswer:
      - Anthocyanin
      - Carotenoid
      - Xanthophyll
      Explanation: Chlorophyll is the primary pigment responsible for photosynthesis,

      TrueAnswer: Stomata
      FalseAnswer:
      - Bud
      - Node
      - Thorn
      Explanation: Stomata are specialized structures in plant leaves responsible
        for gas exchange, regulating the intake of carbon dioxide and release of
