      Explanation: Agricultural expansion, particularly for livestock and crop production,
        drives extensive deforestation, leading to biodiversity loss and ecological
        imbalances in forested regions.
    - Question: What is the term for the loss of water from the soil surface due
        to evaporation and plant transpiration?
      TrueAnswer: Evapotranspiration
      FalseAnswer:
      - Precipitation
      - Infiltration
      - Runoff
      Explanation: Evapotranspiration represents the combined process of water vapor
        release into the atmosphere, crucial for the water cycle and sustaining terrestrial
        ecosystems.

        and permafrost?
      TrueAnswer: Tundra
      FalseAnswer:
      - Rainforest
      - Savanna
      - Desert
      Explanation: The tundra biome, found in high-latitude regions, experiences
        short summers, long winters, and frozen soil, supporting adapted plants and
        wildlife communities.
    - Question: What is the name for the natural process of atmospheric temperature
        rise due to trapped solar radiation?
      TrueAnswer: Greenhouse effect
      FalseAnswer:
      - Albedo effect
      - Coriolis effect
      - Milankovitch cycle
      Explanation: The greenhouse effect, caused by certain gases trapping heat in
        the atmosphere, is essential for maintaining Earth's average surface temperature
        and supporting life.
