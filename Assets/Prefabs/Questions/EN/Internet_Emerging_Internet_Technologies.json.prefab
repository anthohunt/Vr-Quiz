  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the primary function of blockchain technology?
      TrueAnswer: Decentralized ledger
      FalseAnswer:
      - Centralized database
      - Peer-to-peer messaging
      - Cloud storage
      Explanation: Blockchain technology's primary function is to enable decentralized,
        secure, and transparent recording of transactions or data, without the need
        for a central authority or intermediary.
    - Question: Which programming language is commonly used for developing smart
        contracts on Ethereum?
      TrueAnswer: Solidity
      FalseAnswer:
      - Python
      - Java
      - C++
      Explanation: Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing
        smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It has a syntax similar to JavaScript
        and C++.
    - Question: What is the purpose of IPFS in the context of decentralized file
        storage?
      TrueAnswer: Distributed file system
      FalseAnswer:
      - Server-based cloud storage
      - Peer-to-peer file sharing
      - Centralized data backup
      Explanation: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol and network designed
        to create a distributed method of storing and accessing files, making it
        resistant to censorship and single points of failure.
    - Question: Which consensus algorithm is utilized by the Ethereum network as
        of 2021?
      TrueAnswer: Proof of Stake (PoS)
      FalseAnswer:
      - Proof of Work (PoW)
      - Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
      - Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
      Explanation: Ethereum is in the process of transitioning from Proof of Work
        to Proof of Stake, a more energy-efficient consensus algorithm that offers
        rewards to validators for creating and verifying new blocks.
    - Question: What is the main advantage of using a decentralized VPN (dVPN) over
        a traditional VPN?
      TrueAnswer: Enhanced privacy and security
      FalseAnswer:
      - Faster speed
      - Lower cost
      - Access to geo-blocked content
      Explanation: Decentralized VPNs leverage blockchain technology to provide enhanced
        privacy and security by eliminating the need for central servers, reducing
        the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to user information.
    - Question: Which emerging technology aims to enable automated and trustless
        execution of agreements and contracts?
      TrueAnswer: Smart contracts
      FalseAnswer:
      - Quantum computing
      - Biometric authentication
      - Augmented reality
      Explanation: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of
        the agreement directly written into code. They aim to automate processes
        and ensure trustless execution without the need for intermediaries.
    - Question: What is the primary objective of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms?
      TrueAnswer: Providing financial services without intermediaries
      FalseAnswer:
      - Offering traditional banking services
      - Facilitating centralized investment
      - Regulating global financial markets
      Explanation: DeFi platforms aim to enable access to financial services, such
        as borrowing, lending, and trading, without relying on traditional intermediaries
        like banks or financial institutions, using blockchain technology for transparency
        and security.
    - Question: Which emerging internet technology facilitates the creation and trade
        of unique digital assets?
      TrueAnswer: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
      FalseAnswer:
      - Centralized digital currency
      - Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
      - Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
      Explanation: NFTs are digital assets representing ownership or proof of authenticity
        of unique items, using blockchain technology to enable the creation, ownership,
        and trade of one-of-a-kind digital content, such as art, collectibles, and
        virtual real estate.
    - Question: In the context of decentralized storage, what role does Filecoin
        play?
      TrueAnswer: Decentralized storage marketplace
      FalseAnswer:
      - Blockchain consensus protocol
      - Crypto exchange platform
      - Decentralized identity management
      Explanation: Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that transforms cloud
        storage into an algorithmic market. Users can effectively rent out their
        unused storage space and earn Filecoin tokens as incentives for storing and
        retrieving data.
    - Question: Which technology aims to provide a decentralized and censorship-resistant
        domain name system?
      TrueAnswer: Handshake
      FalseAnswer:
      - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
      - Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
      - Centralized domain registrar
      Explanation: Handshake is a decentralized, permissionless naming protocol compatible
        with the existing domain name system. It seeks to create an alternative,
        censorship-resistant internet naming system by using blockchain technology.
