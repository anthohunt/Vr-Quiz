  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the primary technique in Molecular Gastronomy?
      TrueAnswer: Spherification
      FalseAnswer:
      - Frying
      - Grilling
      - Boiling
      Explanation: Spherification involves shaping liquids into spheres resembling
        caviar or pearls using food additives and a calcium bath.
    - Question: Which chef is famously known for popularizing Molecular Gastronomy?
      TrueAnswer: "Ferran Adri\xE0"
      FalseAnswer:
      - Gordon Ramsay
      - Julia Child
      - Jamie Oliver
      Explanation: "Ferran Adri\xE0, the former head chef of elBulli in Spain, is
        often credited as the pioneer of Molecular Gastronomy."
    - Question: What gelling agent is commonly used in Molecular Gastronomy?
      TrueAnswer: Agar-agar
      FalseAnswer:
      - Gelatin
      - Cornstarch
      - Pectin
      Explanation: Agar-agar, derived from seaweed, is a vegetarian gelling agent
        frequently used in Molecular Gastronomy due to its stability.
    - Question: What tool is essential for creating foam in Molecular Gastronomy
        dishes?
      TrueAnswer: Nitrous oxide dispenser
      FalseAnswer:
      - Blender
      - Whisk
      - Sieve
      Explanation: The nitrous oxide dispenser, commonly known as a whipping siphon,
        is utilized to infuse liquids with nitrogen to create foams in Molecular
        Gastronomy.
    - Question: Which famous dessert is often deconstructed in Molecular Gastronomy?
      TrueAnswer: Tiramisu
      FalseAnswer:
      - Cheesecake
      - "Cr\xE8me br\xFBl\xE9e"
      - Panna cotta
      Explanation: Tiramisu, a classic Italian dessert, is deconstructed in Molecular
        Gastronomy to incorporate avant-garde techniques while maintaining its traditional
        flavors.
