      TrueAnswer: Spiral galaxy
      FalseAnswer:
      - Elliptical galaxy
      - Irregular galaxy
      - Lenticular galaxy
      Explanation: Spiral galaxies have a prominent central bulge, surrounded by
        sweeping spiral arms containing young stars and dust lanes.
    - Question: What is the defining feature of an irregular galaxy?
      TrueAnswer: Lack of a regular structure
      FalseAnswer:
      - Lack of stars
      - Absence of dark matter

      Explanation: Irregular galaxies lack the distinct shapes and structures of
        spiral or elliptical galaxies, often exhibiting chaotic and asymmetric appearances.
    - Question: What type of galaxies contain little to no gas and dust, with an
        aging stellar population?
      TrueAnswer: Elliptical galaxies
      FalseAnswer:
      - Dwarf galaxies
      - Starburst galaxies
      - Active galaxies
      Explanation: Elliptical galaxies are characterized by their smooth and featureless
        appearance, primarily composed of old stars and lacking the gas and dust
        present in spiral galaxies.
    - Question: What determines the classification of a galaxy as a barred spiral?
      TrueAnswer: Presence of a central bar-like structure
      FalseAnswer:
      - Lack of spiral arms
      - Absence of globular clusters
      - High metallicity
      Explanation: Barred spiral galaxies feature a prominent elongated central bar
        extending from the core, influencing the structure and motion of stars within
        the galaxy.
    - Question: What gravitational phenomenon enhances the gravitational lensing
        effect in galaxy clusters?
      TrueAnswer: Dark matter
      FalseAnswer:
      - Neutrinos
      - Photons
      - Cosmic rays
      Explanation: The presence of dark matter in galaxy clusters amplifies the gravitational
        lensing effect, distorting and magnifying the light from background objects.
    - Question: What is the name for a group of galaxies associated through mutual
        gravitational attraction?
      TrueAnswer: Galactic group
      FalseAnswer:
      - Star cluster
      - Cosmic web
      - Galactic filament
      Explanation: Galactic groups typically consist of a few to tens of galaxies
        that are bound together by their shared gravitational influence within a
        larger cosmic structure.
    - Question: Which feature plays a significant role in shaping the morphology
        of galaxies?
      TrueAnswer: Tidal interactions with other galaxies
      FalseAnswer:
      - Cosmic expansion
      - Asteroid impacts
      - Quasar emissions
      Explanation: Tidal interactions between galaxies can induce gravitational forces
        that disrupt or rearrange their structures, impacting their overall appearance
        and evolution.
    - Question: What is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way?
      TrueAnswer: Andromeda
      FalseAnswer:
      - Pinwheel

        clusters?
      TrueAnswer: Dwarf galaxies
      FalseAnswer:
      - Spiral galaxies
      - Elliptical galaxies
      - Irregular galaxies
      Explanation: Dwarf galaxies, due to their smaller size and mass, are commonly
        found in the outskirts of galaxy clusters, influenced by the cluster's gravitational
        interactions.
    - Question: What is the estimated number of galaxies in the observable universe?
      TrueAnswer: Hundreds of billions
      FalseAnswer:
      - Tens of thousands
      - Millions
      - Trillions
      Explanation: Current estimates suggest that there are hundreds of billions
        of galaxies in the observable universe, each containing varying numbers of
        stars and celestial objects.
    - Question: What causes a galaxy to exhibit a blue shift in its spectrum?
      TrueAnswer: Approaching Earth
      FalseAnswer:
      - Moving away from Earth
      - Remaining stationary
      - Absorbing cosmic radiation
      Explanation: A blue shift occurs when a galaxy's light is shifted to shorter
        wavelengths, indicating that the galaxy is moving closer to Earth.
    - Question: What is the predominant color of the gas and dust clouds in the Milky
        Way's galactic disk?
      TrueAnswer: Reddish brown
      FalseAnswer:
      - Green
      - Blue
      - Black
      Explanation: The gas and dust clouds in the Milky Way's galactic disk appear
        reddish brown due to the scattering and absorption of light by interstellar
        particles and organic compounds.
    - Question: What is the staggering distance spanned by the largest galactic filaments
        in the universe?
      TrueAnswer: Hundreds of millions of light-years
      FalseAnswer:
      - Thousands of light-years
      - Billions of light-years
      - Tens of light-years
      Explanation: Galactic filaments, the largest known structures, can stretch
        hundreds of millions of light-years across the cosmic web, connecting galaxy
        clusters in the universe.
    - Question: Which type of galactic structures are characterized by a flat and
        disk-like shape?
      TrueAnswer: Lenticular galaxies
      FalseAnswer:
      - Elliptical galaxies
      - Irregular galaxies
      - Spiral galaxies
      Explanation: Lenticular galaxies have a disk-like structure similar to spiral
        galaxies but lack the prominent spiral arms, often resembling a cross between
        elliptical and spiral galaxies.
