        underlying land?
      TrueAnswer: Ice Sheet
      FalseAnswer:
      - Iceberg
      - Glacier
      - Ice Cap
      Explanation: Ice sheets cover large areas and are not confined by topographic
        features, unlike glaciers and ice caps.
    - Question: Which of the following is used to measure the depth and shape of
        the seabed?
      TrueAnswer: Bathymetry
      FalseAnswer:
      - Topography
      - Hygrometer
      - Anemometer
      Explanation: Bathymetry involves using sonar and other techniques to map and
        study the ocean floor's topography and features.
    - Question: What process involves the refreezing of snow or ice into more compact,
        granular ice?
      TrueAnswer: Firnification
      FalseAnswer:
      - Freezing Rain
      - Sleet Formation
      - Ice Crystallization
      Explanation: Firnification is a key stage in the transformation of snow into
        glacial ice, altering its physical properties over time.
    - Question: What is the term for the boundary between two adjoining water bodies
        with different densities?
      TrueAnswer: Halocline
      FalseAnswer:
      - Thermocline
      - Pycnocline
      - Isopycnal
      Explanation: A halocline represents a distinct transition zone where the density
        of seawater changes rapidly with depth due to variations in salinity.
    - Question: What type of wetland contains a significant amount of peat deposits?
      TrueAnswer: Bog
      FalseAnswer:
      - Swamp
      - Marsh
      - Fen
      Explanation: Bogs are characterized by acidic, nutrient-poor conditions that
        favor the accumulation of peat, formed from partially decayed plant matter.
    - Question: Which term describes the process of water seeping from the ground
        and re-entering rivers or lakes?
      TrueAnswer: Groundwater Discharge
      FalseAnswer:
      - Evaporation
      - Transpiration
      - Percolation
      Explanation: Groundwater discharge replenishes surface water bodies, contributing
        to streamflow and maintaining ecological balance.
    - Question: What physical property of water enables it to absorb and store large
        amounts of heat?
      TrueAnswer: High Specific Heat
      FalseAnswer:
      - Low Viscosity
      - Minimal Conductivity
      - Low Surface Tension
      Explanation: Water's high specific heat capacity allows it to moderate temperature
        changes in aquatic environments, influencing climate patterns.
    - Question: What type of landform is created by the erosion of limestone, dolomite,
        or gypsum?
      TrueAnswer: Karst Topography
      FalseAnswer:
      - Mesa
      - Plateau
      - Butte
      Explanation: Karst landscapes develop as soluble rocks dissolve over time,
        forming distinctive features such as sinkholes, caves, and underground rivers.
    - Question: Which of the following is a large-scale oceanic circulation pattern
        driven by winds and temperature differences?
      TrueAnswer: Gyre
      FalseAnswer:
      - Thermohaline Circulation
      - "El Ni\xF1o"
      - "La Ni\xF1a"
      Explanation: Gyres are significant circular currents that play a crucial role
        in distributing heat, nutrients, and marine life across the oceans.

      TrueAnswer: Orographic Effect
      FalseAnswer:
      - Coriolis Force
      - Foehn Wind
      - Convergence Zone
      Explanation: The orographic effect results in moist air rising over mountains,
        cooling, and releasing precipitation on the windward side, leading to a rain
        shadow on the leeward side.

      TrueAnswer: Watershed
      FalseAnswer:
      - Drainage Basin
      - Aquifer
      - Estuary
      Explanation: A watershed represents a distinct geographical area where all
        surface water and runoff flow into the same river, lake, or ocean outlet.
    - Question: What process involves the transfer of water from plants to the atmosphere

      TrueAnswer: Transpiration
      FalseAnswer:
      - Photosynthesis
      - Respiration
      - Capillarity
      Explanation: Transpiration plays a vital role in the water cycle, regulating
        plant temperature and maintaining moisture balance in ecosystems.

      FalseAnswer:
      - Unconfined Aquifer
      - Water Table
      - Perched Water Table
      Explanation: The saturated zone indicates the depth at which groundwater fills
        all available spaces, playing a crucial role in aquifer dynamics and water
        supply.
