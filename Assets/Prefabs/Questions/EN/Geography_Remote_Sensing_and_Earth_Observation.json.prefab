      TrueAnswer: Species identification
      FalseAnswer:
      - Urban heat island analysis
      - Wildfire monitoring
      - Volcano monitoring
      Explanation: While thermal remote sensing can detect temperature variations,
        it is not typically used for species identification, but rather for environmental
        and natural disaster monitoring.
    - Question: What type of orbit enables a sensor to repeatedly observe the same
        area?
      TrueAnswer: Sun-synchronous
      FalseAnswer:
      - Polar
      - Geostationary
      - Molniya
      Explanation: Sun-synchronous orbits synchronize with the Sun's position, causing
        the satellite to pass over the same part of the Earth at the same local solar
        time on each orbit.
