      TrueAnswer: Mercator projection
      FalseAnswer:
      - Gnomonic projection
      - Robinson projection
      - Mollweide projection
      Explanation: The Mercator projection, developed in 1569, is used for world
        maps due to its accuracy in preserving straight lines and angles but distorting
        size near the poles.

      Explanation: Street maps focus on urban or suburban areas, highlighting streets,
        buildings, and points of interest to aid in navigation and city planning.
    - Question: What is the purpose of a nautical chart?
      TrueAnswer: Navigation at sea
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weather forecasting
      - Astronomy
      - Geological surveying
      Explanation: Nautical charts provide essential information for safe navigation
        at sea, including water depths, coastal features, and navigational hazards.
    - Question: Which method is commonly used for accurate GPS-based mapping?
      TrueAnswer: Trilateration
      FalseAnswer:
      - Triangulation
      - Bilateration
      - Pseudorange positioning
      Explanation: Trilateration, using the distance from at least three satellites
        to determine a receiver's position, is a key technique in GPS-based mapping.
    - Question: What type of map focuses on a specific theme, such as population
        density?
      TrueAnswer: Thematic map
      FalseAnswer:
      - Geological map
      - Climatic map
      - Topographic map
      Explanation: Thematic maps visualize specific geographic themes or phenomena,
        such as population distribution, climate patterns, or economic activity.
    - Question: Which projection preserves accurate relative size but distorts shape?
      TrueAnswer: Gnomonic projection
      FalseAnswer:
      - Conic projection
      - Cylindrical projection
      - Robinson projection
      Explanation: The gnomonic projection accurately represents relative sizes of
        features but distorts shapes, commonly used in navigation and astronomy.
    - Question: What is the study and practice of mapmaking called?
      TrueAnswer: Cartography
      FalseAnswer:
      - Geodesy
      - Geography
      - Topography
      Explanation: Cartography involves the design, production, and interpretation
        of maps, incorporating elements of art, science, and technology for effective
        communication of spatial information.
    - Question: Which map type primarily shows the natural physical features of an
        area?
      TrueAnswer: Physical map
      FalseAnswer:
      - Thematic map
      - Political map
      - Satellite map
      Explanation: Physical maps emphasize natural landforms such as mountains, rivers,
        and bodies of water, providing insight into the Earth's physical geography.
    - Question: What is the standard unit used to measure distance on a map?
      TrueAnswer: Scale
      FalseAnswer:
      - Legend
      - Key
      - Compass
      Explanation: The scale on a map provides the ratio of a distance on the map
        to the corresponding distance on the ground, facilitating accurate distance
        measurement.
    - Question: Which instrument is used to determine directions on a map?
      TrueAnswer: Compass
      FalseAnswer:
      - Sextant
      - Alidade
      - Theodolite
      Explanation: A compass, containing a magnetized pointer aligned with the Earth's
        magnetic field, indicates the direction of north, aiding in map orientation
        and navigation.
    - Question: Which organization sets standards for mapping and geospatial data?
      TrueAnswer: International Organization for Standardization
      FalseAnswer:
      - United Nations
      - Geological Society of America
      - National Geographic Society
      Explanation: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides
        guidelines for mapping, geospatial data, and cartographic representation
        to ensure international consistency and accuracy.
    - Question: What is the line of longitude opposite the Prime Meridian?

      FalseAnswer:
      - Equator
      - Tropic of Cancer
      - Tropic of Capricorn
      Explanation: "The International Date Line, mostly following the 180\xB0 meridian,
        marks the boundary where the date changes when traveling east or west, impacting
        timekeeping and mapping."
    - Question: What tool is used to measure distances on a map?
      TrueAnswer: Scale bar
      FalseAnswer:
      - Protractor
      - Compass
      - Ruler
      Explanation: A scale bar on a map presents a visual representation of distance,
        allowing users to measure the proportion of map units to actual ground distance.
    - Question: What type of map displays property boundaries and land ownership?
      TrueAnswer: Cadastral map
      FalseAnswer:
      - Urban map
      - Topographic map
      - Geological map
      Explanation: Cadastral maps delineate property boundaries and land ownership,
        serving as fundamental tools for land management, taxation, and real estate
        development.
    - Question: What is used to indicate direction on a topographic map?
      TrueAnswer: Contour lines
      FalseAnswer:
      - Wind rose
      - Magnetic declination
      - Scale
      Explanation: Contour lines on a topographic map connect points of equal elevation,
        providing visual cues for understanding the shape, steepness, and orientation
        of the terrain.
    - Question: What is the main purpose of an azimuthal map projection?
      TrueAnswer: Preserve directions from a central point
      FalseAnswer:
      - Minimize area distortion
      - Maintain true shapes
      - Equal-area representation
      Explanation: Azimuthal projections preserve accurate directions from one central
        point, commonly used for air and sea navigation, as well as depicting polar
        regions.
    - Question: Which type of map projection minimizes distortion but sacrifices
        accuracy in shape and scale?
      TrueAnswer: Equal-area projection
      FalseAnswer:
      - Conformal projection
      - Cylindrical projection
      - Homolosine projection
