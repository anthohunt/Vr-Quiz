  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the most common injury in American football?
      TrueAnswer: Concussion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Fracture
      - Sprain
      - Tendonitis
      Explanation: Concussions often occur due to high-impact collisions. They can
        have long-term effects on brain health and cognitive function.
    - Question: Which nutrient is essential for muscle recovery after exercise?
      TrueAnswer: Protein
      FalseAnswer:
      - Iron
      - Vitamin C
      - Calcium
      Explanation: Protein aids in repairing and rebuilding muscles after physical
        activity. It helps promote muscle growth and reduce muscle soreness.
    - Question: What is the term for excessive sweating during physical activity?
      TrueAnswer: Hyperhidrosis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Hypoglycemia
      - Hypertension
      - Hypothermia
      Explanation: Hyperhidrosis can affect athletes, causing discomfort and impacting
        performance. Proper hydration and clothing choices can help manage it.
    - Question: What is the ideal time for post-workout stretching?
      TrueAnswer: After exercising
      FalseAnswer:
      - Before exercising
      - During exercise
      - Random times
      Explanation: Stretching after exercise helps improve flexibility, reduce muscle
        tension, and decrease the risk of injury during physical activities.
    - Question: Which sport is associated with the term 'runner's knee'?
      TrueAnswer: Running
      FalseAnswer:
      - Cycling
      - Swimming
      - Tennis
      Explanation: Runner's knee, or patellofemoral pain syndrome, is a common injury
        among runners due to repetitive stress on the knee joint.
    - Question: What role does the ACL play in sports injuries?
      TrueAnswer: Stabilizing the knee
      FalseAnswer:
      - Supporting the ankle
      - Protecting the hip
      - Stabilizing the elbow
      Explanation: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) helps stabilize the knee,
        and injuries to it often require surgical intervention and extensive rehabilitation.
    - Question: What is the recommended hydration strategy for endurance athletes?
      TrueAnswer: Regular fluid intake
      FalseAnswer:
      - Dehydration before exercise
      - Drinking large volumes at once
      - Hydrating only after the activity
      Explanation: Endurance athletes should maintain regular fluid intake during
        training and competitions to prevent dehydration and maintain performance
        levels.
    - Question: Which muscle group is commonly strained in baseball pitchers?
      TrueAnswer: Rotator cuff
      FalseAnswer:
      - Quadriceps
      - Hamstrings
      - Glutes
      Explanation: The repetitive throwing motion places strain on the rotator cuff,
        often leading to overuse injuries and requiring careful rehabilitation.
    - Question: What is the ideal duration for an athlete's warm-up prior to training
        or competition?
      TrueAnswer: 15-20 minutes
      FalseAnswer:
      - 5 minutes
      - 30 minutes
      - 1 hour
      Explanation: A 15-20 minute warm-up allows for gradual increases in heart rate,
        body temperature, and blood flow, preparing the body for activity.
    - Question: What is the most common cause of ankle sprains in athletes?
      TrueAnswer: Inversion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Eversion
      - Plantar flexion
      - Dorsiflexion
      Explanation: Inversion ankle sprains occur when the foot rolls inward, stressing
        the outer ligaments. Proper rehabilitation is crucial for preventing recurrent
        sprains.
