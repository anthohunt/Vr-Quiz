  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the most common method for solving first-order linear differential
        equations?
      TrueAnswer: Integrating factor
      FalseAnswer:
      - Separation of variables
      - Euler's method
      - Matrix exponentiation
      Explanation: The integrating factor method is widely used for solving first-order
        linear differential equations and involves multiplying both sides of the
        equation by an integrating factor to simplify the equation for integration.
    - Question: What is the general solution to a homogeneous second-order linear
        differential equation?
      TrueAnswer: y=c1 e^(r1x) + c2 e^(r2x)
      FalseAnswer:
      - y=c1 sin(x) + c2 cos(x)
      - y=c1 e^(rx)
      - y=c1 x^2 + c2 x
      Explanation: In the case of distinct real roots r1 and r2, the general solution
        of a homogeneous second-order linear differential equation is in the form
        y=c1 e^(r1x) + c2 e^(r2x), where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
    - Question: What type of differential equation can be solved using Laplace transforms?
      TrueAnswer: Linear constant-coefficient differential equations
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nonlinear differential equations
      - Partial differential equations
      - Stochastic differential equations
      Explanation: Laplace transforms are particularly effective for solving linear
        constant-coefficient differential equations, transforming the differential
        equation into an algebraic equation, which can be more easily solved.
    - Question: What is the characteristic equation of a second-order linear homogeneous
        differential equation?
      TrueAnswer: r^2 + ar + b = 0
      FalseAnswer:
      - r^3 + ar^2 + br + c = 0
      - r + a = 0
      - ar^2 + br + c = 0
      Explanation: The characteristic equation of a second-order linear homogeneous
        differential equation is in the form r^2 + ar + b = 0, where r represents
        the roots of the characteristic equation, determining the form of the solution.
    - Question: What is the primary advantage of using power series solutions for
        solving differential equations?
      TrueAnswer: Applicability to non-constant coefficient equations
      FalseAnswer:
      - Faster convergence than other methods
      - Guaranteed convergence for all functions
      - Simplicity in implementation
      Explanation: Power series solutions provide a powerful method for solving differential
        equations with non-constant coefficients, allowing for the determination
        of the behavior of the solution near singular points and the analysis of
        special functions.
