        change?
      TrueAnswer: Significant contributor
      FalseAnswer:
      - Minimal impact
      - No impact
      - Fluctuating impact
      Explanation: Melting ice caps contribute significantly to sea-level rise by
        releasing stored water into the oceans, posing risks to coastal communities
        and ecosystems.
    - Question: How does climate change impact the distribution of infectious diseases
        carried by vectors like mosquitoes?
      TrueAnswer: Expanded range and transmission
      FalseAnswer:
      - Decreased transmission
      - No impact
      - Limited range expansion
      Explanation: Climate change expands the range of vector-borne diseases by creating
        favorable conditions for disease-carrying organisms, affecting human and
        wildlife health.
