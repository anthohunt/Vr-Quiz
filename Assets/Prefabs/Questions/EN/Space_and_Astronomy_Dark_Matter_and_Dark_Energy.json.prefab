  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the estimated percentage of dark matter in the universe?
      TrueAnswer: 27%
      FalseAnswer:
      - 10%
      - 40%
      - 60%
      Explanation: Dark matter is estimated to make up about 27% of the universe's
        total mass-energy density.
    - Question: Which type of matter is dark matter believed to interact gravitationally
        but not electromagnetically?
      TrueAnswer: Non-baryonic
      FalseAnswer:
      - Baryonic
      - Luminous
      - Exotic
      Explanation: Dark matter is thought to be non-baryonic, meaning it is composed
        of particles beyond the standard model of particle physics.
    - Question: What is the most common type of material making up normal matter
        in the universe?
      TrueAnswer: Baryonic
      FalseAnswer:
      - Dark
      - Luminous
      - Invisible
      Explanation: Baryonic matter is the ordinary matter that makes up stars, planets,
        and everything that we can see and detect through electromagnetic radiation.
    - Question: What is the primary evidence for the existence of dark matter?
      TrueAnswer: Gravitational effects
      FalseAnswer:
      - Electromagnetic radiation
      - Nuclear reactions
      - Chemical reactions
      Explanation: The primary evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational
        effects on galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the
        universe.
    - Question: What is the approximate percentage of dark energy in the universe?
      TrueAnswer: 68%
      FalseAnswer:
      - 40%
      - 20%
      - 10%
      Explanation: Dark energy constitutes about 68% of the universe's total energy
        density and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.
    - Question: What is dark energy believed to produce in the universe?
      TrueAnswer: Negative pressure
      FalseAnswer:
      - Positive pressure
      - Zero pressure
      - Repulsive gravity
      Explanation: Dark energy is theorized to have negative pressure, driving the
        accelerated expansion of the universe in opposition to the gravitational
        attraction of matter.
    - Question: What is the estimated equation of state parameter for dark energy?
      TrueAnswer: -1
      FalseAnswer:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      Explanation: The equation of state parameter for dark energy, denoted as w,
        is estimated to be approximately -1, consistent with a cosmological constant
        or vacuum energy.
    - Question: What is the characteristic behavior of dark energy over large distances?
      TrueAnswer: Expansion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Contraction
      - Stabilization
      - Oscillation
      Explanation: Dark energy causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate
        over large distances, driving galaxies apart at an increasing rate.
    - Question: What is the primary method for studying dark energy?
      TrueAnswer: Cosmic expansion history
      FalseAnswer:
      - Particle collision experiments
      - Solar system dynamics
      - Radio telescope observations
      Explanation: Studying the cosmic expansion history through observations of
        supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure provides
        insights into dark energy.
    - Question: What is the current leading theory regarding the nature of dark energy?
      TrueAnswer: Cosmological constant
      FalseAnswer:
      - Scalar field model
      - Quantum fluctuation
      - Modified gravity
      Explanation: The leading theory posits dark energy as a cosmological constant,
        representing a constant energy density throughout space, consistent with
        Einstein's cosmological constant in general relativity.
