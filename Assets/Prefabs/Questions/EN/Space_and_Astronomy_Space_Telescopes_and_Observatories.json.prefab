  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the primary function of the Hubble Space Telescope?
      TrueAnswer: Observing distant galaxies
      FalseAnswer:
      - Studying asteroids
      - Measuring star brightness
      - Searching for black holes
      Explanation: The Hubble Space Telescope is known for its role in significantly
        expanding our understanding of the universe by capturing images of distant
        galaxies and celestial phenomena.
    - Question: Which space observatory operates primarily in the X-ray part of the
        electromagnetic spectrum?
      TrueAnswer: Chandra X-ray Observatory
      FalseAnswer:
      - Spitzer Space Telescope
      - Kepler Space Telescope
      - James Webb Space Telescope
      Explanation: The Chandra X-ray Observatory is specifically designed to detect
        and observe X-ray emission from high-energy regions of the universe, including
        black holes and supernovae remnants.
    - Question: What is the main purpose of the James Webb Space Telescope?
      TrueAnswer: Studying the early universe
      FalseAnswer:
      - Hunting for exoplanets
      - Mapping the asteroid belt
      - Observing solar flares
      Explanation: The James Webb Space Telescope aims to study the universe's first
        stars and galaxies, as well as the formation of planetary systems, to provide
        insights into the early universe.
    - Question: Which space telescope is known for its infrared observations of the
        cosmos?
      TrueAnswer: Spitzer Space Telescope
      FalseAnswer:
      - Hubble Space Telescope
      - Chandra X-ray Observatory
      - Kepler Space Telescope
      Explanation: The Spitzer Space Telescope is renowned for its pioneering work
        in the field of infrared astronomy, enabling the study of cool and distant
        objects such as protostars and exoplanets.
    - Question: What space observatory has been crucial for the discovery and study
        of exoplanets?
      TrueAnswer: Kepler Space Telescope
      FalseAnswer:
      - Hubble Space Telescope
      - Chandra X-ray Observatory
      - James Webb Space Telescope
      Explanation: The Kepler Space Telescope revolutionized the study of exoplanets
        by detecting thousands of planetary candidates, providing valuable data for
        understanding planetary systems beyond our solar system.
