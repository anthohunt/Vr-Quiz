      FalseAnswer:
      - Tannins
      - Aldehydes
      - Esters
      Explanation: Isohumulones are bitter compounds derived from hops, balancing
        the sweetness of malt in beer and providing distinct flavor profiles.
    - Question: What contributes to the gel-like consistency of fruit preserves and
        jellies?
      TrueAnswer: Pectin
      FalseAnswer:
      - Agar
      - Gelatin
      - Xanthan gum
      Explanation: Pectin, naturally present in fruits, forms a gel network when
        combined with sugar and acid, giving preserves their characteristic texture.
    - Question: What process involves breaking fat globules in milk into smaller,
        more uniform particles?
      TrueAnswer: Homogenization
      FalseAnswer:
      - Pasteurization
      - Fermentation
      - Clarification
      Explanation: Homogenization prevents the separation of cream by dispersing
        fat globules evenly throughout milk, ensuring a consistent texture and mouthfeel.
    - Question: What type of molecules are primarily responsible for the texture
        of ice cream?
      TrueAnswer: Fat globules and ice crystals
      FalseAnswer:
      - Proteins and sugars
      - Air bubbles and emulsifiers
      - Fruit particles and syrups
      Explanation: The balance between fat globules and ice crystals dictates the
        smoothness, creaminess, and mouthfeel of ice cream.
    - Question: What compound contributes to the floral and citrus aroma in many
        wines?
      TrueAnswer: Terpenes
      FalseAnswer:
      - Esters
      - Lactones
      - Phenols
      Explanation: Terpenes, naturally occurring in grape skins, are responsible
        for the aromatic complexity and varietal character in wines.
    - Question: Which enzyme breaks down proteins into smaller peptides during cheese
        ripening?
      TrueAnswer: Protease
      FalseAnswer:
      - Lipase
      - Amylase
