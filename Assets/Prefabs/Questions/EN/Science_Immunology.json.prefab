  - Questions:
    - Question: Which cells in the immune system are responsible for producing antibodies?
      TrueAnswer: B cells
      FalseAnswer:
      - T cells
      - Natural killer cells
      - Macrophages
      Explanation: B cells, a type of white blood cell, are responsible for producing
        antibodies to neutralize and eliminate pathogens.
    - Question: What is the protein on the surface of a virus or bacteria that triggers
        an immune response called?
      TrueAnswer: Antigen
      FalseAnswer:
      - Antibody
      - Pathogen
      - Enzyme
      Explanation: Antigens are specific proteins on the surface of pathogens that
        the immune system recognizes as foreign, triggering an immune response.
    - Question: Which type of immunity is acquired through vaccination or exposure
        to a pathogen?
      TrueAnswer: Active immunity
      FalseAnswer:
      - Passive immunity
      - Innate immunity
      - Adaptive immunity
      Explanation: Active immunity is achieved when the body produces its own immune
        response, either through vaccination or natural exposure to a pathogen.
    - Question: What is the process by which white blood cells engulf and digest
        foreign particles called?
      TrueAnswer: Phagocytosis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Endocytosis
      - Exocytosis
      - Pinocytosis
      Explanation: Phagocytosis is the mechanism by which immune cells engulf and
        digest foreign particles, such as bacteria or dead cells.
    - Question: Which class of antibodies is the most common in the bloodstream?
      TrueAnswer: IgG
      FalseAnswer:
      - IgA
      - IgM
      - IgE
      Explanation: IgG antibodies are the most common type found in the bloodstream
        and play a key role in providing long-term immunity.
    - Question: What is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) responsible for
        in the immune system?
      TrueAnswer: Presenting antigens to T cells
      FalseAnswer:
      - Producing antibodies
      - Destroying pathogens
      - Activating B cells
      Explanation: MHC molecules present antigens to T cells, allowing the immune
        system to recognize and mount a response against specific pathogens.
    - Question: Which specialized immune cells release histamine during an allergic
        response?
      TrueAnswer: Mast cells
      FalseAnswer:
      - Neutrophils
      - Eosinophils
      - Basophils
      Explanation: Mast cells release histamine, triggering the symptoms of an allergic
        response, such as itching, swelling, and mucus production.
    - Question: Which type of T cells coordinate the immune response and activate
        other immune cells?
      TrueAnswer: Helper T cells
      FalseAnswer:
      - Killer T cells
      - Memory T cells
      - Regulatory T cells
      Explanation: Helper T cells play a central role in coordinating and regulating
        the immune response by activating other immune cells when an antigen is present.
    - Question: What is the main function of natural killer (NK) cells in the immune
        system?
      TrueAnswer: Destroying virus-infected cells and tumor cells
      FalseAnswer:
      - Producing antibodies
      - Phagocytosis of bacteria
      - Releasing histamine
      Explanation: NK cells are specialized in recognizing and eliminating virus-infected
        cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization.
    - Question: Which immunoglobulin is the first to be produced during an initial
        immune response?
      TrueAnswer: IgM
      FalseAnswer:
      - IgG
      - IgA
      - IgE
      Explanation: IgM antibodies are the first to be produced during the initial
        immune response to an infecting pathogen.
