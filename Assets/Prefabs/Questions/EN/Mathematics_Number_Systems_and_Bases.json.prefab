    - Question: What is the decimal equivalent of binary number 1011?
      TrueAnswer: 11
      FalseAnswer:
      - 7
      - 13
      - 15
      Explanation: The binary number 1011 is equivalent to 11 in decimal as (1x2^3)
        + (0x2^2) + (1x2^1) + (1x2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11.
    - Question: In the hexadecimal system, what is the value of the letter 'A'?
      TrueAnswer: 10
      FalseAnswer:
      - 7
      - 12
      - 15
      Explanation: In the hexadecimal system, 'A' represents the value 10. The numbers
        0-9 are represented as usual.
    - Question: What base is the octal number '52' in decimal?
      TrueAnswer: 42
      FalseAnswer:
      - 12
      - 23
      - 68
      Explanation: The octal number 52 is equivalent to 42 in decimal, as (5x8^1)
        + (2x8^0) = 40 + 2 = 42.
    - Question: Which of the following is a valid base for number systems?
      TrueAnswer: Base-5
      FalseAnswer:
      - Base-11
      - Base-8
      - Base-16
      Explanation: Base-5 is a valid number system base, while Base-11, Base-8, and
        Base-16 are also common.
    - Question: What is the next line in the Fibonacci sequence after 13?
      TrueAnswer: 21
      FalseAnswer:
      - 16
      - 18
      - 24
      Explanation: The next number in the Fibonacci sequence after 13 is 21, derived
        by adding the previous two numbers (8 + 13 = 21).
    - Question: What is the Roman numeral representation of the number 50?
      TrueAnswer: L
      FalseAnswer:
      - C
      - X
      - D
      Explanation: The Roman numeral representation of the number 50 is 'L', representing
