      TrueAnswer: Westerlies
      FalseAnswer:
      - Trade winds
      - Polar easterlies
      - Doldrums
      Explanation: The westerlies are prevailing winds from the west that bring warm,
        moist air to the western coast of continents, influencing the climate and
        precipitation patterns.
    - Question: What type of rainfall occurs when warm, moist air is forced to rise
        over a mountain range, causing precipitation on the windward side?
      TrueAnswer: Orographic
      FalseAnswer:
      - Convectional
      - Cyclonic
      - Frontal
      Explanation: Orographic rainfall is caused by moist air rising over a mountain
        range, cooling and condensing to form clouds and precipitation on the windward

      TrueAnswer: Oxygen levels
      FalseAnswer:
      - Latitude
      - Altitude
      - Ocean currents
      Explanation: Oxygen levels are not a primary factor influencing climate, unlike
        latitude, altitude, and ocean currents, which play significant roles in shaping
        regional climates.
    - Question: What is the term for a large-scale, persistent wind pattern that
        occurs in the lower troposphere in response to Earth's rotation and thermal
        properties?
      TrueAnswer: Jet stream
      FalseAnswer:
      - Chinook
      - Mistral
      - Bora
      Explanation: The jet stream is a narrow, fast-flowing air current in the lower
        troposphere, influenced by Earth's rotation and temperature contrasts, impacting
        weather patterns and aviation routes.
    - Question: Which of the following is a mechanism by which cloud cover and atmospheric
        particles can influence climate?
      TrueAnswer: Albedo effect
      FalseAnswer:
      - Coriolis effect
      - Chinook effect
      - Monsoon effect

        solar radiation and re-radiating it as heat energy?
      TrueAnswer: Radiative forcing
      FalseAnswer:
      - Condensation
      - Sublimation
      - Evapotranspiration
      Explanation: Radiative forcing is the process of the Earth's surface absorbing

      FalseAnswer:
      - Trade winds
      - Haboob
      - Foehn
      Explanation: A sea breeze is a localized, persistent wind pattern caused by
