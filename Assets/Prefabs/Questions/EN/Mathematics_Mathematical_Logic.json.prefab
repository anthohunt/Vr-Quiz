      FalseAnswer:
      - Affirming the consequent
      - Appeal to authority
      - Begging the question
      Explanation: The argument from ignorance fallacy assumes a statement is true
        because it has not been proven false, a common error in reasoning addressed
        in mathematical logic and critical thinking.
