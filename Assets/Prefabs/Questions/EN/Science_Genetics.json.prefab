  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the unit of heredity transmission called?
      TrueAnswer: Gene
      FalseAnswer:
      - Chromosome
      - Allele
      - Mutation
      Explanation: Genes are the basic unit of heredity and can be passed down from
        parent to offspring, influencing traits and characteristics.
    - Question: What is the term for different forms of a gene?
      TrueAnswer: Allele
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nucleotide
      - Codon
      - Locus
      Explanation: Alleles are variations of a single gene and can result in different
        traits or characteristics in an organism.
    - Question: What process creates new combinations of genes in offspring?
      TrueAnswer: Meiosis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Mitosis
      - Recombination
      - Mutation
      Explanation: Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in four daughter
        cells, each with half the number of chromosomes of the original cell, creating
        genetic diversity in offspring.
    - Question: Which molecule carries genetic information in cells?
      TrueAnswer: DNA
      FalseAnswer:
      - RNA
      - Protein
      - Carbohydrate
      Explanation: DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the genetic instructions
        for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms
        and many viruses.
    - Question: What is the term for the complete set of an organism's genes?
      TrueAnswer: Genome
      FalseAnswer:
      - Phenotype
      - Genotype
      - Exon
      Explanation: The genome is the entirety of an organism's hereditary information
        encoded in its DNA, including all of its genes and other non-coding sequences.
    - Question: Which scientist first discovered the structure of DNA?
      TrueAnswer: James Watson
      FalseAnswer:
      - Francis Crick
      - Rosalind Franklin
      - Gregor Mendel
      Explanation: James Watson, along with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, elucidated
        the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, revolutionizing genetics and molecular
        biology.
    - Question: What is the term for a sudden, permanent change in a gene?
      TrueAnswer: Mutation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Translocation
      - Inversion
      - Deletion
      Explanation: Mutations can occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to
        mutagens, and they can lead to genetic diversity and the evolution of species.
    - Question: Which disorder is characterized by an extra chromosome 21?
      TrueAnswer: Down syndrome
      FalseAnswer:
      - Turner syndrome
      - Klinefelter syndrome
      - Cystic fibrosis
      Explanation: Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic condition
        caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.
    - Question: Who is considered the 'Father of Genetics'?
      TrueAnswer: Gregor Mendel
      FalseAnswer:
      - Charles Darwin
      - Alfred Russel Wallace
      - Thomas Hunt Morgan
      Explanation: Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian friar and scientist, is renowned
        for his pioneering work on pea plants, establishing the fundamental principles
        of heredity.
    - Question: What is the term for the study of heredity and variation in organisms?
      TrueAnswer: Genetics
      FalseAnswer:
      - Embryology
      - Ecology
      - Physiology
      Explanation: Genetics encompasses the study of genes, genetic variation, and
        heredity in living organisms, providing insights into inheritance patterns
        and genetic traits.
