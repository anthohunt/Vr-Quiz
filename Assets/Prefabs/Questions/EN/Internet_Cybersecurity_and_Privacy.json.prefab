      FalseAnswer:
      - Stealing personal emails
      - Overloading servers
      - Modifying software code
      Explanation: Pharming is a cyber attack aimed at redirecting a website's traffic
        to another, bogus website, often with the intent to gather user information
        for malicious purposes.

        access?
      TrueAnswer: Strong passwords
      FalseAnswer:
      - Publishing login credentials
      - Using public Wi-Fi
      - Sharing account details
      Explanation: Using strong, unique, and complex passwords, combined with two-factor
        authentication, is a common and effective measure to secure online accounts
        from unauthorized access.
    - Question: Which type of malware is designed to block access to a computer system
        until a sum of money is paid?
      TrueAnswer: Ransomware
      FalseAnswer:
      - Adware
      - Spyware
      - Trojan horse
      Explanation: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a user's
        data and demands payment for its release, often causing significant disruption
        and financial loss to individuals and organizations.
    - Question: What is a common technique to protect sensitive data in an email
        communication?
      TrueAnswer: Encryption
      FalseAnswer:
      - Open sharing
      - Digital signatures
      - Attachment password protection
      Explanation: Encryption allows for secure transmission of sensitive data in
        email communications, making the content unreadable to unauthorized parties
        without the decryption key.
    - Question: What role does a security patch play in cybersecurity?
      TrueAnswer: Fixing vulnerabilities
