      - Cleansing the air
      - Providing warmth to animals
      - Creating barriers for predators
      Explanation: Frequent fires play a crucial role in rejuvenating grasslands
        and savannas by preventing the encroachment of woody plants and promoting
        the growth of diverse grass species, thus maintaining the ecosystem's open
        landscape.
    - Question: Which of the following animals is well-adapted to the dry conditions
        of a savanna?
      TrueAnswer: Meerkat
      FalseAnswer:
      - Polar bear
      - Penguin
      - Humpback whale
      Explanation: Meerkats have evolved to thrive in the arid savanna environment,
        displaying adaptations like keen sense of smell and highly social behavior
        to survive in the harsh conditions.
    - Question: What is the main threat to the grasslands and savannas brought by
        the overgrazing of livestock?
      TrueAnswer: Soil erosion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Forest encroachment
      - Decline in herbivore population
      - Water scarcity
      Explanation: Overgrazing by livestock can lead to soil erosion, as the removal
        of vegetation cover and trampling of the soil can destabilize the land, resulting
        in loss of fertile topsoil and reduced productivity.
    - Question: Which of the following is a type of savanna characterized by scattered
        trees and tall grasses?
      TrueAnswer: Woodland savanna
      FalseAnswer:
      - Tropical savanna
      - Temperate grassland
      - Floodplain savanna
      Explanation: Woodland savannas feature a mix of trees and tall grasses, creating
        a diverse ecosystem that supports a variety of wildlife adapted to both open
        grasslands and shaded woodland areas.
    - Question: What adaptation allows the African elephant to thrive in the savanna
        environment?
      TrueAnswer: Large ears for cooling
      FalseAnswer:
      - Long tusks for defense
      - Thick fur for warmth
      - Humped back for water storage
      Explanation: The African elephant uses its large ears to regulate body temperature,
        as the extensive network of blood vessels helps dissipate excess heat, crucial
        for surviving in the savanna's hot climate.
