        observations, interviews, or open-ended survey responses, providing insights
        into underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations.
    - Question: What is the significance level in hypothesis testing?
      TrueAnswer: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true
      FalseAnswer:
      - The confidence interval
      - The p-value
      - The precision of the measurement
      Explanation: The significance level, often denoted by alpha, is the probability
        of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, indicating the chance of
        making a Type I error in hypothesis testing.
    - Question: What is a scientific theory?
      TrueAnswer: A well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural
        world
      FalseAnswer:
      - An unproven hypothesis
      - A random guess
      - A subjective opinion
      Explanation: A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some
        aspect of the natural world that is based on a body of evidence and has stood
        rigorous testing and scrutiny.
    - Question: What is the last step in the scientific method?
      TrueAnswer: Draw a conclusion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Analyze the results
      - Collect more data
      - Revise the hypothesis
      Explanation: Drawing a conclusion involves analyzing the data collected during
        the experiment to determine whether the hypothesis is supported or rejected.
    - Question: What is the purpose of randomization in an experiment?
      TrueAnswer: To reduce bias and confounding variables
      FalseAnswer:
      - To ensure equal group sizes
      - To control for external influences
