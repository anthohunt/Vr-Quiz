        possibilities, is a key aspect of the 'Ideate' phase.
    - Question: How does Design Thinking view failure in the innovation process?
      TrueAnswer: As a source of learning and iteration
      FalseAnswer:
      - As a final outcome
      - As a sign of incompetence
      - As a reason for project abandonment
      Explanation: Design Thinking perceives failure as an opportunity for learning
        and improvement, encouraging iterations and refinements in the design process.
    - Question: What does the 'Empathize' phase of Design Thinking involve?
      TrueAnswer: Understanding and empathizing with users
      FalseAnswer:
      - Creating potential solutions
      - Evaluating prototypes
      - Developing marketing strategies
      Explanation: Empathize requires designers to immerse themselves in the users'
        experiences, gaining deep insights into their needs and challenges.
    - Question: In Design Thinking, what is the purpose of the 'Define' phase?
      TrueAnswer: To pinpoint the core problem
