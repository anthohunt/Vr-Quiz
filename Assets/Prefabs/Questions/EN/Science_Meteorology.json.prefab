      TrueAnswer: Barometer
      FalseAnswer:
      - Anemometer
      - Hygrometer
      - Thermometer
      Explanation: A barometer is a device used to measure atmospheric pressure,
        crucial for weather forecasting and monitoring atmospheric changes.
    - Question: What type of cloud brings thunderstorms and heavy rain?
      TrueAnswer: Cumulonimbus
      FalseAnswer:
      - Cirrostratus
      - Altostratus
      - Stratocumulus
      Explanation: Cumulonimbus clouds are associated with thunderstorms and heavy
        precipitation, often producing lightning, thunder, and sometimes hail.
    - Question: What is the name for the science of studying weather patterns, climates,
        and atmospheric conditions?
      TrueAnswer: Meteorology
      FalseAnswer:
      - Astronomy
      - Geology
      - Biology
      Explanation: Meteorology is the scientific study of the atmosphere, focusing
        on weather processes, climate, and atmospheric phenomena.
    - Question: What causes the Coriolis effect in the atmosphere?
      TrueAnswer: Earth's rotation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Moon's gravity
      - Solar radiation
      - Atmospheric pressure
      Explanation: The Coriolis effect is caused by the Earth's rotation, deflecting
        the path of moving objects, including air masses, in the atmosphere.
    - Question: What condition does a hygrometer measure in the atmosphere?
      TrueAnswer: Humidity
      FalseAnswer:
      - Pressure
      - Temperature
      - Wind speed
