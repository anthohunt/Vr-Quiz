    - Question: Which practice aims to minimize the impact of wildlife on agriculture
        while maintaining the natural balance of ecosystems?
      TrueAnswer: Integrated Pest Management
      FalseAnswer:
      - Open Hunting Seasons
      - Invasive Species Removal
      - Pesticide Overuse
      Explanation: Integrated Pest Management promotes natural pest control methods,
        reducing the need for lethal measures against wildlife in agricultural areas.
    - Question: What is a common reason for human-elephant conflict in certain regions?
      TrueAnswer: Habitat Fragmentation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Elephant Overpopulation
      - Insect Pest Infestation
      - Crop Diversity
      Explanation: Habitat fragmentation leads to elephants coming into contact with
        human settlements as their natural habitat becomes increasingly fragmented
        and degraded.
    - Question: Which approach focuses on involving local communities in conservation
        efforts to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts?
      TrueAnswer: Community-based Conservation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Private Game Reserves
      - Zoo Rehabilitation Programs
      - Hunting Safaris
      Explanation: Involving local communities in conservation decisions fosters
        a sense of ownership and responsibility, leading to more sustainable solutions
        for conflict resolution.
    - Question: What is the practice of using scent to deter wildlife from entering
        specific areas?
      TrueAnswer: Scent Marking
      FalseAnswer:
      - Taste Aversion
      - Foraging Enclosures
      - Decoy Predators
      Explanation: Scent marking uses natural or artificial odors to create a barrier
        that repels wildlife from human-dominated spaces without causing harm.
    - Question: How do electric fences contribute to resolving human-wildlife conflicts?
      TrueAnswer: Preventing Crop Damage
      FalseAnswer:
      - Attracting Predators
      - Creating Habitat Barriers
      - Encouraging Human-Wildlife Contact
      Explanation: Electric fences provide a physical barrier that deters wildlife
        from entering agricultural areas, reducing conflicts and crop damage.
    - Question: Which method promotes the understanding and coexistence of wildlife
        within human settlements?
      TrueAnswer: Wildlife-friendly Agriculture
      FalseAnswer:
      - Heavy Metal Poisoning
      - Fur Trapping
      - Extermination Programs
      Explanation: Wildlife-friendly agriculture methods integrate wildlife conservation
        measures with farming practices, creating mutually beneficial environments
        for both humans and wildlife.

        to the balance of ecosystems?
      TrueAnswer: Barn Owl
      FalseAnswer:
      - Fox
      - Raccoon
      - Skunk
      Explanation: Barn owls are effective natural pest controllers, feeding on rodents
        and insects that pose threats to crops, reducing the need for chemical control
        methods.

        and highways, reducing conflicts?
      TrueAnswer: Wildlife Overpasses
      FalseAnswer:
      - Speed Bumps
      - Road Closures
      - Reflective Signage
      Explanation: Wildlife overpasses allow animals to cross roads safely, reducing
        the risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions and mitigating conflicts with human
        infrastructure.
    - Question: What is a potential downside of using lethal methods to resolve human-wildlife
        conflicts?
      TrueAnswer: Disruption of Ecosystem Balance
      FalseAnswer:
      - Enhanced Biodiversity
