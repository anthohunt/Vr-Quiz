        area over a long period?
      TrueAnswer: Climate
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weather
      - Season
      - Temperature
      Explanation: Climate refers to the long-term average weather conditions in
        a specific area, including temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns.
    - Question: Which of the following is a factor that affects local weather patterns?
      TrueAnswer: Topography
      FalseAnswer:
      - Latitude
      - Altitude
      - Ocean currents
      Explanation: Topography, or the physical features of an area, can influence
        local weather patterns by affecting wind flow and precipitation.
    - Question: What is the term for the layer of the Earth's atmosphere where weather
        occurs?
      TrueAnswer: Troposphere
      FalseAnswer:
      - Stratosphere
      - Mesosphere
      - Thermosphere
      Explanation: The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere
        where weather phenomena, such as clouds and storms, take place.
    - Question: Which of the following is a factor that influences ocean currents?
      TrueAnswer: Wind
      FalseAnswer:
      - Temperature
      - Salinity
      - Tides
      Explanation: Wind plays a significant role in driving ocean currents by transferring
        energy to the water's surface.
    - Question: What is the term for the process of water falling from the atmosphere
        to the Earth's surface?
      TrueAnswer: Precipitation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Evaporation
      - Condensation
      - Transpiration
      Explanation: Precipitation is the process by which water in the atmosphere
        falls to the Earth's surface in various forms, such as rain, snow, or hail.

      TrueAnswer: Precipitation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Evaporation
      - Condensation
      - Transpiration
      Explanation: Precipitation is the process by which water vapor in the atmosphere
