      TrueAnswer: H. pylori bacteria
      FalseAnswer:
      - Excessive acid production
      - Spicy food consumption
      - Stress
      Explanation: Most ulcers are caused by the H. pylori bacteria, which damages
        the protective lining of the stomach and small intestine.
    - Question: Which medical breakthrough led to the development of in vitro fertilization
        (IVF)?
      TrueAnswer: Discovery of sperm capacitation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Development of birth control pills
      - Cloning of Dolly the sheep
      - Creation of artificial organs
      Explanation: The discovery of sperm capacitation, the process that enables
        sperm to fertilize an egg, paved the way for IVF.
    - Question: What is the primary function of red blood cells?
      TrueAnswer: Transporting oxygen
      FalseAnswer:
      - Producing antibodies
      - Digesting food
      - Filtering waste
      Explanation: Red blood cells, through the protein hemoglobin, transport oxygen
        from the lungs to the body's tissues.
    - Question: Which medical imaging technique uses magnetic fields and radio waves?
      TrueAnswer: MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
      FalseAnswer:
      - X-ray
      - Ultrasound
      - CT scan
      Explanation: MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images
        of the body's internal structures.
    - Question: What is the leading cause of blindness worldwide?
      TrueAnswer: Cataracts
      FalseAnswer:
      - Glaucoma
      - Macular degeneration
      - Diabetic retinopathy
      Explanation: Cataracts, the clouding of the eye's lens, are the leading cause
        of blindness globally, but they can be treated with surgery.
    - Question: Which medical breakthrough led to the development of the polio vaccine?
      TrueAnswer: Isolation of the poliovirus
      FalseAnswer:
      - Discovery of antibiotics
      - Invention of the microscope
