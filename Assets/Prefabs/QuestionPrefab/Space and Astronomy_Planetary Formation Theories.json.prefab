        from microorganisms transported through space?
      TrueAnswer: Panspermia Theory
      FalseAnswer:
      - Accretion Theory
      - Nebular Theory
      - Steady State Theory
      Explanation: The Panspermia Theory proposes that life on Earth may have originated
        from microorganisms transported through space.
