      TrueAnswer: Wernicke's area
      FalseAnswer:
      - Broca's area
      - Hippocampus
      - Cerebellum
      Explanation: Wernicke's area is involved in the comprehension and understanding
        of language.
    - Question: What is the main function of the parietal lobe?
      TrueAnswer: Sensory processing
      FalseAnswer:
      - Motor control
      - Emotional regulation
      - Memory formation
      Explanation: The parietal lobe is responsible for processing sensory information,
        such as touch, temperature, and pain.
    - Question: Which part of the brain is responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness?
      TrueAnswer: Reticular formation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Thalamus
      - Hippocampus
      - Cerebellum
      Explanation: The reticular formation helps regulate sleep and wakefulness by
        controlling arousal and attention.
    - Question: What is the main function of the temporal lobe?
      TrueAnswer: Auditory processing
      FalseAnswer:
      - Visual processing
      - Motor control
      - Language comprehension
      Explanation: The temporal lobe is primarily responsible for processing auditory
        information, including speech and sound recognition.
