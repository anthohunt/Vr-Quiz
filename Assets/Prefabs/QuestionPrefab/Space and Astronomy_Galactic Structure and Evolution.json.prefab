      - Steady State Theory
      - String Theory
      - Multiverse Theory
      Explanation: The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing cosmological model that
        explains the origin and expansion of the universe.
    - Question: What is the term for a group of stars that form a recognizable pattern?
      TrueAnswer: Constellation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nebula
      - Galaxy
      - Cluster
      Explanation: A constellation is a group of stars that form a recognizable pattern
        or shape, often with mythological or cultural significance.

      TrueAnswer: Nuclear Fusion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nuclear Fission
      - Blackbody Radiation
      - Gravitational Contraction
      Explanation: Nuclear fusion is the process in which stars generate energy by
        fusing hydrogen atoms together to form helium.
    - Question: What is the term for a massive explosion that occurs at the end of
        a star's life?
      TrueAnswer: Supernova
      FalseAnswer:
      - Nova
