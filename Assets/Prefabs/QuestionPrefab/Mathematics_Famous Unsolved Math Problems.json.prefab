        of a circle's circumference to its diameter."
    - Question: What is the Riemann Hypothesis?
      TrueAnswer: All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have a real
        part of 1/2.
      FalseAnswer:
      - The sum of the reciprocals of prime numbers diverges.
      - Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime
        numbers.
      - There are infinitely many prime numbers.
      Explanation: The Riemann Hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution
        of prime numbers and the behavior of the Riemann zeta function.
    - Question: What is the Collatz Conjecture?
      TrueAnswer: For any positive integer, repeatedly applying the Collatz function
        will eventually reach the value 1.
      FalseAnswer:
      - There exists an infinite number of twin primes.
      - The sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the positive integers converges.
      - The decimal representation of pi is a repeating or terminating decimal.
      Explanation: The Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics that
        involves iterating a simple arithmetic function.
    - Question: What is the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture?
      TrueAnswer: There is a relationship between the number of rational points on
        an elliptic curve and the behavior of its L-series.
      FalseAnswer:
      - The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
      - The square root of 2 is an irrational number.
      - The area of a circle is equal to pi times the square of its radius.
      Explanation: The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture is a conjecture in number
        theory that relates the number of rational points on an elliptic curve to
        the behavior of certain mathematical functions.
    - Question: What is the P versus NP problem?
      TrueAnswer: Determining whether every problem whose solution can be verified
        quickly can also be solved quickly.
      FalseAnswer:
      - The sum of the angles of a polygon with n sides is equal to (n-2) * 180 degrees.
      - The square root of 2 is an irrational number.
      - The area of a circle is equal to pi times the square of its radius.
      Explanation: The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer
        science that asks whether every problem for which a solution can be verified
        quickly can also be solved quickly.
    - Question: What is the Goldbach Conjecture?
      TrueAnswer: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of
        two prime numbers.
      FalseAnswer:
      - The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.
      - The square root of 2 is an irrational number.
      - The area of a circle is equal to pi times the square of its radius.
      Explanation: The Goldbach Conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems
        in number theory, stating that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed
        as the sum of two prime numbers.
    - Question: What is the Twin Prime Conjecture?
      TrueAnswer: There are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by
        2.

      - The square root of 2 is an irrational number.
      - The area of a circle is equal to pi times the square of its radius.
      Explanation: The Twin Prime Conjecture states that there are infinitely many
        pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, such as (3, 5), (11, 13), (17, 19),
        and so on.
    - Question: What is the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem?
      TrueAnswer: Determining whether solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations exist
