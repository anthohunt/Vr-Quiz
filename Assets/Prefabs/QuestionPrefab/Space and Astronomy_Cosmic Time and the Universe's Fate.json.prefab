    - Question: What is the concept of the Big Bang?
      TrueAnswer: The initial explosion that created the universe
      FalseAnswer:
      - A theory about the formation of black holes
      - The collision of two galaxies
      - The birth of a new star
      Explanation: The Big Bang refers to the initial explosion that marked the beginning
        of the universe, where all matter and energy originated.
    - Question: What is the concept of the Big Crunch?
      TrueAnswer: The hypothetical collapse of the universe
      FalseAnswer:
      - The expansion of the universe
      - The formation of new galaxies
      - The collision of two black holes
      Explanation: The Big Crunch is a hypothetical scenario where the universe stops
        expanding and collapses back into a singularity, possibly leading to a new
        Big Bang.
    - Question: What is the concept of the Big Freeze?
      TrueAnswer: The universe continues to expand and everything freezes
      FalseAnswer:
      - The universe collapses into a singularity
      - The formation of new stars
      - The steady expansion of galaxies
      Explanation: The Big Freeze describes a scenario where the universe continues
        to expand, causing all energy to be evenly distributed and resulting in a
        frozen, lifeless state.
    - Question: What is the concept of the Steady State?
      TrueAnswer: The universe maintains a constant density as it expands
      FalseAnswer:
      - The universe undergoes periodic cycles of expansion and contraction
      - The universe is constantly shrinking
      - The universe is filled with static matter
      Explanation: The Steady State theory suggests that the universe is constantly
        expanding, but new matter is continuously created to maintain a constant
        density.
    - Question: What is the concept of the Heat Death?
      TrueAnswer: The universe reaches a state of maximum entropy and can no longer
        sustain life
      FalseAnswer:
      - The universe becomes extremely hot and dense
      - The universe collapses into a singularity
      - The universe transitions into a parallel dimension
      Explanation: The Heat Death refers to a hypothetical state where the universe
        reaches maximum entropy, resulting in a uniform distribution of energy and
        the inability to sustain life.
    - Question: What is the concept of the Big Rip?
      TrueAnswer: The universe's expansion accelerates, tearing apart all matter
        and structures
      FalseAnswer:
      - The universe collapses into a singularity
      - The universe reaches a steady state
      - The universe undergoes a Big Freeze
