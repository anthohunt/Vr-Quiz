        or from the entire planet?
      TrueAnswer: Extinction
      FalseAnswer:
      - Endangerment
      - Migration
      - Adaptation
      Explanation: Extinction occurs when a species no longer exists in a particular
        habitat or on the entire planet.
    - Question: What is the process by which water vapor in the atmosphere turns
        into liquid water?
      TrueAnswer: Condensation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Evaporation
      - Precipitation
      - Transpiration
      Explanation: Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the atmosphere
        cools and turns into liquid water, forming clouds.
    - Question: What is the term for the gradual wearing away of land by natural
        forces?
      TrueAnswer: Erosion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Deposition
      - Weathering
      - Melting
      Explanation: Erosion is the process by which land is worn away by natural forces
        such as water, wind, or ice.
    - Question: What is the term for the process by which plants release water vapor
        through their leaves?
      TrueAnswer: Transpiration
      FalseAnswer:
      - Photosynthesis
      - Respiration
      - Evaporation
      Explanation: Transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor
        through their leaves into the atmosphere.
    - Question: What is the term for the introduction of harmful substances into
        the environment?
      TrueAnswer: Pollution
      FalseAnswer:
