  - Questions:
    - Question: What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die?
      TrueAnswer: 1/6
      FalseAnswer:
      - 1/2
      - 1/3
      - 1/4
      Explanation: A fair six-sided die has 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability
        of rolling a 6 is 1/6.
    - Question: What is the mean of the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8?
      TrueAnswer: 5
      FalseAnswer:
      - 4
      - 6
      - 7
      Explanation: The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing
        by the count, which gives (2+4+6+8)/4 = 5.
    - Question: What is the mode of the numbers 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5?
      TrueAnswer: 4
      FalseAnswer:
      - 2
      - 3
      - 5
      Explanation: The mode is the value that appears most frequently, and in this
        case, the number 4 appears 3 times.
    - Question: What is the range of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9?
      TrueAnswer: 8
      FalseAnswer:
      - 4
      - 6
      - 10
      Explanation: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values,
        which in this case is 9-1 = 8.
    - Question: What is the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck
        of playing cards?
      TrueAnswer: 1/2
      FalseAnswer:
      - 1/4
      - 1/3
      - 3/4
      Explanation: A standard deck of playing cards has 26 red cards (13 hearts and
        13 diamonds) out of 52 total cards.
    - Question: What is the median of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
      TrueAnswer: 3
      FalseAnswer:
      - 2
      - 4
      - 5
      Explanation: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in
        ascending order, which in this case is 3.
    - Question: What is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting heads?
      TrueAnswer: 1/2
      FalseAnswer:
      - 1/4
      - 1/3
      - 3/4
      Explanation: A fair coin has 2 equally likely outcomes, so the probability
        of getting heads is 1/2.
    - Question: What is the standard deviation of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
      TrueAnswer: 1.58
      FalseAnswer:
      - 0.5
      - 2.5
      - 3.5
      Explanation: The standard deviation measures the spread of the numbers around
        the mean, and in this case, it is approximately 1.58.
    - Question: What is the probability of drawing a spade from a standard deck of
        playing cards?
      TrueAnswer: 1/4
      FalseAnswer:
      - 1/2
      - 1/3
      - 3/4
      Explanation: A standard deck of playing cards has 13 spades out of 52 total
        cards.
    - Question: What is the mode of the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10?
      TrueAnswer: No mode
      FalseAnswer:
      - 2
      - 4
      - 6
      Explanation: The mode is the value that appears most frequently, but in this
        case, all the numbers appear only once.
    - Question: What is the probability of rolling an odd number on a fair six-sided
        die?
      TrueAnswer: 1/2
      FalseAnswer:
      - 1/3
      - 1/4
      - 2/3
      Explanation: Out of the six equally likely outcomes, three are odd numbers
        (1, 3, and 5), so the probability is 1/2.
    - Question: What is the mean of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9?
      TrueAnswer: 5
      FalseAnswer:
      - 4
      - 6
      - 7
      Explanation: The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing
        by the count, which gives (1+3+5+7+9)/5 = 5.
    - Question: What is the range of the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10?
      TrueAnswer: 8
      FalseAnswer:
      - 4
      - 6
      - 10
      Explanation: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values,
        which in this case is 10-2 = 8.
    - Question: What is the probability of drawing a face card from a standard deck
        of playing cards?
      TrueAnswer: 3/13
      FalseAnswer:

      - 3
      - 7
      - 9
      Explanation: The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in
        ascending order, which in this case is 5.

      FalseAnswer:
      - 0.5
      - 1.5
      - 3.5
