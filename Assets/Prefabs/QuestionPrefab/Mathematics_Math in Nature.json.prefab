        on a stem?
      TrueAnswer: Phyllotaxis
      FalseAnswer:
      - Symmetry axis
      - Leaf arrangement
      - Stem morphology
      Explanation: The arrangement of leaves on a stem follows a pattern called phyllotaxis,
        which can be spiral or opposite.
    - Question: What is the mathematical concept behind the formation of river meanders?
      TrueAnswer: Erosion and deposition
      FalseAnswer:
      - Tectonic activity
      - Glacial movement
      - Volcanic eruptions
      Explanation: River meanders are formed through a combination of erosion on
        the outer bank and deposition on the inner bank.
