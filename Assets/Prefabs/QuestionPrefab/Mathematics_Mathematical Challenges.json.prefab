      - "\u03C0r^2"
      - "(4/3)\u03C0r^2"
      Explanation: "The volume of a sphere can be calculated by multiplying the cube
        of the radius (r) by four-thirds and pi (\u03C0)."
    - Question: What is the value of 9 divided by 3?
      TrueAnswer: 3
      FalseAnswer:
      - 6
      - 9
