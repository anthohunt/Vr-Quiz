      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      Explanation: Chemical weathering is the process by which rocks and minerals
        are broken down through chemical reactions, altering their composition.
    - Question: What is the term for the process of rocks and minerals being broken
        down by physical forces?
      TrueAnswer: Physical weathering
      FalseAnswer:
      - Chemical weathering
      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      Explanation: Physical weathering is the process by which rocks and minerals
        are broken down through physical forces, such as temperature changes or pressure.
    - Question: What is the term for the process of sediment being transported by
        wind, water, or ice?
      TrueAnswer: Erosion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weathering
      - Deposition
      - Compaction
      Explanation: Erosion is the process by which sediment is transported and moved
        by wind, water, or ice, wearing away the Earth's surface.
    - Question: What is the term for the process of rocks and minerals being broken
        down by living organisms?
      TrueAnswer: Biological weathering
      FalseAnswer:
      - Chemical weathering
      - Physical weathering
      - Erosion
      Explanation: Biological weathering is the process by which rocks and minerals
        are broken down through the actions of living organisms, such as plants or
        animals.
    - Question: What is the term for the process of new rock forming from existing
        rock?
      TrueAnswer: Rock cycle
      FalseAnswer:
      - Plate tectonics
      - Weathering
      - Erosion
      Explanation: The rock cycle is a continuous process in which rocks are formed,
        broken down, and reformed through various geological processes.
    - Question: What is the term for the process of heat and pressure transforming
        existing rock into new rock?
      TrueAnswer: Metamorphism
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weathering
      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      Explanation: Metamorphism is the process by which heat and pressure transform
        existing rock into new rock, often resulting in changes in texture and mineral
        composition.

      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      Explanation: Lithification is the process by which loose sediment is compacted

        wind?
      TrueAnswer: Deflation
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weathering
      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      Explanation: Deflation is the process by which wind removes loose sediment

        water?
      TrueAnswer: Fluvial erosion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weathering
      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      Explanation: Fluvial erosion is the process by which water removes and transports

      TrueAnswer: Glacial erosion
      FalseAnswer:
      - Weathering
      - Erosion
      - Deposition
      Explanation: Glacial erosion is the process by which glaciers move and transport

      FalseAnswer:
      - Weathering
      - Erosion
      - Deposition
